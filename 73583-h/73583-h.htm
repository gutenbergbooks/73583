<p class="dropcap">It seems a little remarkable that an institution
at once so popular and so
universal as fairs should not heretofore
have found an historian. The fact
may perhaps be accounted for in the circumstance
that fairs, as now regarded, are associated with
notions of frivolity. Many of the circumstances
connected with their origin are certainly not generally
known. They were the product of a blending
of Religion with Commerce, suited to the genius of
former ages, but finding little sympathy now. They
have been associated with the development of commerce
in the nations of Europe—perhaps in the
nations of the world.</p>

<p>The materials for such a history are reasonably
abundant upon diligent search. They do not lie
upon the surface. Prolonged investigation revealed
so much, that for the purpose of this work some
selection became necessary. I had to consider
whether it would be more instructive to present
the incomplete outline of a number of fairs ranging
throughout the world, or to select some of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
ones at home and abroad, past and present,
and trace minutely their origin, their development,
and their decadence. I determined upon the latter
course; and this, too, notwithstanding that Mr.
Henry Morley had already traced in much detail
one of the great fairs whose records it would become
necessary for me to traverse.</p>

<p>I was chiefly led to the decision stated from the
fact that the greatest fair ever held in this country,
and held for many centuries—that of <i>Sturbridge</i>,
by Cambridge—had hitherto found no historian;
yet many of its annals are on record in a form of
undoubted authenticity. It seemed to me that it
would be more instructive to follow such a history
through its successive phases than to present a
series of minor sketches, however varied the details
should be. I trust it may be felt that I have selected
the right course. The other materials brought
together are not lost; they are only held over, and
will receive the benefit of some additions and corrections.
They can be had when called for, and they
will reveal much that is new, even after this work
shall have been read.</p>

<p>The greatest fair in England was that of <span class="smcap">Sturbridge</span>;
the greatest fair in London that of <span class="smcap">St.
Bartholomew</span>, Smithfield. Their histories are
here given. They have some points of resemblance;
but on the whole they represent two really distinct
pictures of old English manners.</p>

<p>The fairs of Continental Europe required some
elucidation. I have given therefore an outline of
several of the more notable fairs of <span class="smcap">France</span>, including<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
those most famous gatherings of the middle
ages at Champagne and Brie. Concerning these
latter I have been able to present some original
documents, forming part of the records of the City
of London, and now for the first time printed.
Many of these fairs are things of the past. I have
added an outline of the fairs of <span class="smcap">Russia</span>, including
the great fair of <i>Nijni-Novgorod</i>, because these are
institutions of the present. I think the history of
this last-named fair has not previously been written
in such detail.</p>

<p>I trust that the work will be found reasonably
free alike from author’s and from printer’s errors.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The origin of Fairs, like that of many
other ancient institutions, is involved
in much obscurity. The almost universal
belief is that they were associated
with religious observances; or, as Mr. Morley
poetically puts it: “the first fairs were formed by
the gathering of worshippers and pilgrims about
sacred places, and especially within or about the
walls of abbeys and cathedrals, on the Feast days
of the Saints enshrined therein.” The sacred building
and its surroundings being too small to provide
accommodation, tents were pitched; and as the resources
of the district would no more suffice to
victual than to lodge its throngs of visitors, stalls
were set up by provision dealers; and later these
were turned to more general purposes of trade.
This incidental origin seems, in some cases, hardly
sufficient to account for the results which followed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
but then it has ever been the genius of commerce
to follow close upon the wants of the people.</p>

<p>The establishment of fairs as a source of revenue
to religious houses was probably a later development.
The Church has always been keenly alive to its temporal
interests. And while it was one of its principal
functions to administer hospitality to the needy
and decrepit, there was justice in drawing contributions
from those who too soon might have to rely
upon its bounty. Certain it is that nearly all the
early charters which I shall have to notice in the
progress of this work were shaped in view of granting
tolls and revenue to the purposes of religion
and charity.</p>

<p>The signification of the word Fair (French <i>foire</i>) is
in the Latin <i>forum</i> a market-place, or <i>feriæ</i> holidays.
But the German designation <i>Messen</i> seems still more
significant, as being a word employed to denote
the most solemn part of the Church service—the
mass (Latin <i>missa</i>). The association of ideas here
implied strengthens with every step of investigation.
In the time of Constantine the Great (fourth century
of Christian era) Jews, Gentiles, and Christians
assembled in great numbers to perform their several
rites about a tree reputed to be the oak mambre
under which Abraham received the angels. At
the same place, adds Zosimus, there came together
many traders, both for sale and purchase of their
wares. St. Basil, towards the close of the sixth
century, complained (<i>De Ascetisis</i>) that his own
Church was profaned by the public fairs held at the
martyr’s shrines. While Michaud (“History of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Crusades,” i., <span class="allsmcap">II</span>) records that under the Fatimite
Caliphs, in the eleventh century, a fair was held on
Mount Calvary on the 15th September every year,
in which were exchanged the productions of Europe
for those of the East. Gibbon implies an earlier
date, in stating that it was promoted by the frequent
pilgrimages between the seventh and the eleventh
centuries. This Fair was of special importance in
the commerce of the Italians with the East. <i>Vide</i>
Cunningham’s “Growth of English Industry and
Commerce,” 1882, p. 120, n.</p>

<p>These notes are but preliminary and introductory:
the inquiry has now to take a wider range.</p>

<p><i>Greece.</i>—The association of commerce with religious
observances seems indeed not to have originated
in or with the Christian Church. It is supposed
for instance that at the celebrated Greek
games, such as those at Olympia, &amp;c., trade was no
entirely subordinate object; and this idea gains
confirmation from various passages in the ancient
classic authors. Cicero expressly states that even so
early as the age of Pythagoras, a great number of
people attended the religious games for the special
purpose of trading. At Delphi, Nemæa, Delos, or
the Isthmus of Corinth, a fair was held almost every
year. The Amphyctionic fairs were held twice a
year. In the time of Chrysostom, these fairs were
infamously distinguished for a traffic in slaves, destined
for public incontinence.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Amphyctionic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
spring fair was held at Delphi, and the autumn
fair at Thermopylæ: in fact at the same times that
the deputies from the States of Greece formed the
Amphyctionic Council—another proof that wherever
large assemblies of people took place in Greece,
for religious or political purposes, advantage was
taken to carry on traffic. At the fairs of Thermopylæ
medicinal herbs and roots, especially hellebore,
were sold in large quantities.</p>

<p>It may be taken for granted that one principal
reason why the religious games or the political
assemblies of the States were fixed upon to hold the
fairs was that during these, <i>all hostilities were suspended</i>:
and every person might go with his merchandise
in safety to them, even through an enemy’s
country. The priests, so far from regarding these
fairs as a profanation of the religious ceremonies,
encouraged them; and the priests of Jupiter, in
particular, advanced large sums on interest to such
merchants as had good credit, but had not sufficient
money with them, <i>vide</i> Stevenson’s “Historical
Sketch of the Progress of Discovery, Navigation
and Commerce,” vol. 18 of Kerr’s “Travels,”
1824.</p>

<p><i>Early Eastern Nations.</i>—By reference to “The
Books of the Prophets,” we are enabled to realize
the importance of the fairs in the ancient commerce
of the great city of Tyre (probably <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 597-74)
“the crowning city whose merchants were
princes, whose traffickers the honourable of the
earth” (Isaiah xxiii. 8). Thus in Ezekiel xxvii.:—</p>

<p>“12. Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver,
iron, tin and lead, they traded in thy fairs....</p>

<p>“14. They of the house of Togarmah traded
in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and
mules....</p>

<p>“16. Syria was thy merchant by reason of the
multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied
in thy fairs with emeralds, purple and broidered
work, and fine linen and coral and agate....</p>

<p>“19. Dan also and Javan going to and fro
occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus,
were in thy market....</p>

<p>“22. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah,
they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy
fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious
stones and gold....</p>

<p>“27. Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise,
thy mariners shall fall into the midst of the seas in
the day of thy ruin.”</p>

<p>The merchant traders mentioned here claim
ancestry from families mentioned Genesis x. 3-7.
The expression “they occupied” may be rendered
“they inhabited.” In the same chapter,
in alternate verses, there are many references to
markets.</p>

<p><i>Rome.</i>—It is asserted by learned writers (Fosbroke
and others) that fairs, as such, took their
origin in ancient Rome. Romulus, Servius, Tullius,
and the Republic, at its commencement, are severally
said to have instituted fairs, in order that the
country people might come in every ninth day
(<i>nundinæ</i>) to hear the laws proclaimed, or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
decrees of the people delivered.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Other public
business was transacted thereat. Booths, tents, and
wooden stands for shows were always usual in such
places. The fairs were frequently held in the
public streets; and one of the most constant objects
of sale or barter was that of indulgences! Dogs,
and especially greyhounds, were sold at these Roman
fairs. It is further said that the fairs were appointed
to be held on Saints’ days <i>in order that
trade might attract those whom religion could not
influence</i>. The monasteries sold goods, probably
such as their inmates and surrounding dependents
could manufacture.</p>

<p>Courts for the purposes of adjudicating upon
questions of dispute arising out of the dealings at
the fairs were held alike in Greece and Rome;
these being similar to the Piepowder Courts of the
middle ages, and most likely their precursors. In
time of war, fairs were guarded by soldiers, attempts
at plunder being frequent. Bells were provided in
fairs for the purpose of giving speedy alarm.</p>

<p>It has been generally admitted that the Romans
introduced the practice of holding fairs into the
north of Europe. I think I shall make it abundantly
clear that they introduced them into England.</p>

<p><i>Italy.</i>—It is towards the close of the fifth century
of the Christian era that we first find any authentic
account of fairs specially designed as marts for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
commerce. Like many other incidents associated
with the history of commerce, the first traces are
found in Italy. The Western Roman Empire had
become extinguished; but Italy had fallen into
good hands. Theodoric the Chief or King of the
Ostro-Goths had done much to revive its agriculture,
and something for its commerce. Foreign
merchants began to visit it again; and about
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 493 several <i>fairs</i> were appointed for the purpose
of exchanging its redundant produce with
the merchandise of other countries. Many rich
Jew traders settled in Rome; and by means of
these fairs a wide interchange of commodities was
effected.</p>

<p><i>Germany.</i>—We next turn to <i>Germany</i>. We know
that the Emperor Charles the Great (Charlemagne)
towards the close of the eighth century
paid great attention to the commerce of western
Europe—a fact indeed which seems difficult to be
reconciled with the circumstance that he allowed
the priests to make a canon declaring all interest for
the use of money to be sinful! It may be that he
yielded this point in the hope that commercial
dealings would soon explode the fallacy. He recognized
in fairs a means of exchange of commodities
well suited to the times. The great fairs of
his period were those of Aquisgranum (<i>Aix la
Chapelle</i>) and of <i>Troyes</i>. These were frequented
during his reign by traders from most parts of
Europe. The weight used at the latter fair for
dealings in coin—then often accepted by weight
only on account of its battered condition—became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
adopted as the weight for bullion in all parts of
Europe—the pound troy.</p>

<p><i>Flanders.</i>—Our attention is next directed here.
The woollen manufactures commenced probably in
the latter half of the tenth century (960). At first
the sales were mostly to the French, whose thrifty
habits enabled them to purchase fine woollen cloths
for wear. On account of the scarcity of coin the
trade was mostly carried on by barter, to facilitate
which Baldwin, Earl of Flanders—who seems to
have exceeded most of the sovereigns of that period
in desiring the real interest of himself and his subjects—set
up weekly markets, and established
regular fairs at <i>Bruges</i>, <i>Courtray</i>, <i>Torhout</i> and <i>Mont-Casel</i>,
at all which he exempted the goods sold or
exchanged from paying any duties on being brought
in or carried out. The new trade was thus greatly
extended, and it continued to flourish for several
centuries—largely due to its being widely known
through the fairs of Europe.</p>

<p><i>France.</i>—Much of the European commerce of
the middle ages was transacted at the celebrated
fairs of Champagne and Brie. There the merchants
of Italy, Spain and France congregated.
From far distant climes the Genoese transported
thither bales of goods; and busy traders came to
meet in open market the infant efforts of Belgian
manufacturers from Yprès, Douai, and Bruges.
Burgundy sent cloth, Catalonia leather, and the
Genoese and Florentines brought silks; while at
all the seaports along their coasts vast cargoes
were unshipped and placed on the backs of mules<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
to wend their way to the place appointed for the
fair.</p>

<p>These fairs would begin with the sale of cloth,
perhaps for seventeen days; the cloth merchants
would settle their accounts prior to the silk merchants
entering upon their bargains. In the middle
of it all the great cry “Ara” was raised, as a signal
for the money-changers to take their seats, and for
four weeks they sat for the benefit of the various
nationalities who wished to realize their gains in
their native coin.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the fair a busy time of
fifteen days was set apart for those who had not
yet settled their accounts, and to rectify disputes;
which time was extended in favour of the representatives
of more distant people who wished to go
home and return before finally completing their
books. The Genoese bursar at these fairs had
always a month allowed him before settling his
accounts.</p>

<p>Bent (in his “Genoa: how the Republic Rose and
Fell,” 1881) from whom we have drawn some of
the preceding details says (p. 106) these fairs in
southern France were not without their political
significance. Besides bringing hither their merchandise,
the Italian traders imported into these
towns their spirit of independence and their love of
republicanism. It was from the south of France
that the seeds of liberty, equality, and fraternity
spread northwards. No greater stronghold of the
rights of the third estate existed than at Marseilles.
To this day the influence of this fact is strong on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the politics of France. And the principles inculcated
by the independent traders of Italy took deep
root here under the eyes of despotism, and found a
truly favourable soil in which to develop. The
French revolution, and the state of France as it is
to-day, may owe their first source to these very
times when a Genoese merchant would repair to
these fairs, proud and boastful of his own freedom,
of his vote in the General Council, and of a government
which owned no royal master; and all this
could be said with a sneer at the people over whom
the banner of the lilies held despotic sway.</p>

<p><i>North of Europe.</i>—Towards the close of the tenth
century periodical public markets or fairs were
established in the northern portions of Europe, and
were used for a purpose altogether new in these
higher latitudes, but arising out of the rapine and
hostilities peculiar to the period. In several of the
North German towns the merchandise brought to
them consisted of slaves taken in the wars—many of
which were believed to have been fermented for the
simple purpose of carrying off captives. Helmold
relates that he saw 7,000 Danish slaves at one time
exposed for sale in the market at Mecklenberg. The
common price of ordinary slaves of either sex was
about a mark (or 8 oz.) of silver; but some female
slaves for their beauty or qualifications were rated
as high as three marks. (<i>Vide</i> Thorkelin’s “Essay
on the Slave Trade,” pp. 4-9.)</p>

<p>We arrive at the close of the sixteenth century.
The city of <i>Antwerp</i> had at this period arrived very
nearly at the summit of its wealth and glory, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Anderson (“Hist. of Commerce,” ii., p. 25) considers
it had acquired by two principal means:—</p>

<p>I. By the grants of free fairs for commerce,
made formerly by the sovereigns of the Netherlands—two
of which fairs lasted each time six weeks—whither
merchants resorted from all parts of
Christendom with their merchandise, custom free.
<i>At these fairs vast concerns were managed, not only in
merchandise, but in bills of exchange with all parts of
Europe.</i></p>

<p>II. It had become the entrepot of the commerce
between the southern and northern ports of Europe,
and especially of the Portuguese merchants. This
drew the German and other merchants to settle
there; and the merchants of <i>Bruges</i> largely removed
thither after the Archduke Maximilian had (about
1499) reduced their city. The fairs were aided by,
and themselves aided, this development.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the preceding survey I have intentionally
omitted any mention of <i>England</i>.
Historians of the ordinary type
have thought it beneath their dignity
to refer to anything so common-place as fairs. The
real mainsprings of our commerce seem in fact very
generally to have escaped them. The greatest commercial
nation of the world has found no historian
willing to record the true causes of its greatness.
The intrigues of sovereigns, the machinations of
ecclesiastics; the trickeries of statesmen and diplomatists,
have alone commanded their attention and
absorbed their limited energies. The Statute-book,
the one great storehouse of our national history, has
escaped their observation. I propose to devote a
special chapter to the origin and development of
fairs in England.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that the Anglo-Saxons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
founded alike fairs and markets in England. To
Alfred the Great the honour is usually assigned. I
have no doubt whatever that the Romans first introduced
the practice of holding markets and fairs
in England. I find very distinct traces of fairs of
Roman origin at <i>Helston</i> (Cornwall), at <i>Barnwell</i>
(by Cambridge), at <i>Newcastle-upon-Tyne</i>, and at
several places along the line of the Roman wall in
Northumberland. But assuming that the institutions
of the country were largely recast during the
Anglo-Saxon period, we may take note of the supposed
re-institution of markets and fairs in the
ninth century. The tithings held their sittings in
their tithing or free-borough once a week, and
many people coming thither to have their matters
adjudicated upon, brought also their garden produce,
corn, beasts, and <i>id genus omne</i>, for sale: because
there they could meet one another, and buy
and sell as their needs required, hence the commencement
of a market weekly. From the Courts just
mentioned there lay an appeal, if either plaintiff or
defendant were not satisfied, to a County Court,
held about Easter and Michaelmas, and over these
a bishop and ealderman presided. To this superior
Court also came numbers who, at the various intermediate
Court-leets were not satisfied. And as large
numbers came together, a greater and better opportunity
was afforded for selling their wares and
goods, corn, beasts, stuffs, linens. “<i>In this we
can trace the origin of fairs</i>, which were generally
held twice a year, on or about the times mentioned.”
This is the dictum of Mr. G. Lambert, F.S.A., in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
a paper read before the London and Middlesex
Archæological Society in 1880, the substance of
which is published in the “Antiquary,” ii., pp.
102-3. The fairs here are seen to be purely secular
institutions.</p>

<p>It was by the <i>Normans</i> that the fairs of England
were moulded into the shape with which we are
most familiar. The Norman kings placed themselves
largely under the influence of the Papal
throne; and it was to the Church, or in the interest
of the Church, that nearly all fairs were
granted after the Norman Conquest in the eleventh
century. It was under John, early in the thirteenth
century, that the power of the Church became most
pronounced in England, and it is during this reign
that most of the existing charters of fairs date.</p>

<p>Trying to harmonize these somewhat conflicting
views, it may be supposed that some of our fairs at
least were established during the Roman occupation.
These were probably largely added to during the
Anglo-Saxon period. The Normans admittedly
encouraged fairs in the interest of the Church.
The fairs of the first and second category were
mostly fairs established by prescription, the latter
were chiefly established by charter. But in the
course of centuries the identity of origin becomes
lost. Shepheard, in his “Corporations, Fraternities,
and Guilds” (published 1659), says: “It is
very usual in these Charters to confirm the old
markets and fairs, and to grant new markets and
Fairs. Or to change the dayes of the old markets
or Fairs. And to grant to the Corporation the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Py-powder Court and Incidents and profits of the
Fair.” (P. 69.)</p>

<p>I am disposed to believe that many of the early
fairs associated with religious observances and ceremonies,
were in their inception fairs of prescription
only: that is to say, fairs which took their origin
in passing events, without any special authority,
and that upon later occasions charters were obtained.
Bailey says that in ancient times amongst
Christians, upon any extraordinary solemnity, particularly
the anniversary dedication of a church,
tradesmen used to bring and sell their wares even
in the churchyards, especially upon the festival of
the dedication; as at Westminster, on St. Peter’s
Day; at London, on St. Bartholomew’s; at Durham,
on St. Cuthbert’s Day, &amp;c.; but riots and
disturbances often happening, by reason of the
numbers assembled together, privileges were by
royal charter granted, for various causes, to particular
places, towns, and places of strength, where
magistrates presided, to keep the people in order.
(“Pop. Antiq.,” Brand.)</p>

<p>Blackstone says:—Fairs and markets, with the
tolls belonging to them, can only be set up by virtue
of the royal grant, or by long and immemorial usage
and prescription, which presupposes such a grant.
The limitation of these public resorts to such time
and such place as may be most convenient for the
neighbourhood forms a part of economics, or domestic
polity, which, considering the kingdom as a
large family, and the sovereign as the master of it, he
clearly has a right to dispose and order as he pleases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Again, a man may have a right to hold a fair or
market, or to keep a boat for the ferrying of
passengers; and this either by royal grant or by
prescription, from which a royal grant may be presumed
to have been at some time conferred. But
(unless under an Act of Parliament) no other title
than these will suffice; for no fair, market, or ferry
can be lawfully set up without license from the
Crown. On the other hand, a man may, under
such titles, lawfully claim to be lord of a fair or
market, though he be not the owner of the soil on
which it is held.</p>

<p>The right to take toll is usually (though not
necessarily) a part of the privilege; and the tolls of
a fair or market are due either in respect of goods
sold there (that is, from the seller, not the buyer),
or for stallage or pickage, or the like, in respect of
stalls or polls fixed in the soil.</p>

<p>I have seen it stated that before the granting of
a fair it was customary to issue a writ of <i>ad quod
damnum</i>, to inquire whether the grant would be
prejudicial to any; but I doubt if the practice was
at all general.</p>

<p>If I am entitled to hold a fair or market, and
another person sets up a fair or market so near mine
that he does me a prejudice, it is a nuisance to the
freehold which I have in my market or fair. But
in order to make this out to be a nuisance it is
necessary (1) That my market or fair be the elder,
otherwise the nuisance lies at my own door. (2)
That the market be erected within the third part of
twenty miles from mine. Sir M. Hale construes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the <i>dieta</i> or reasonable day’s journey mentioned by
Bracton, to be twenty miles; as, indeed, it is usually
understood, not only in our own law, but also in the
civil law, from which we probably borrowed it.
So that if the new fair or market be not within
seven miles of the old one, it is no nuisance; for it
is held reasonable that every man should have a
market within one-third of a day’s journey from his
own home; that the day being divided into three
parts, he may spend one part in going, another in
returning, and the third in transacting his necessary
business there. If such market or fair be on the
same day with mine, it is <i>primâ facie</i> a nuisance
to mine, and there needs no proof of it, but the
law will intend it to be so; but if any other day it
<i>may</i> be a nuisance; but of this there must be proof.</p>

<p>The statute of Gloucester (1278) conferred the
right of inquiring into the title of all who claimed
rights usually exercised by the Crown. Where such
rights were questioned, the judicial process of <i>quo
warranto</i> was set in motion. One of the principal
matters about which inquisition was frequently made
under this statute was the right of holding markets
and fairs. This right could (as we have seen) only
be conferred by royal grant, where prescription
could not be pleaded. In many cases it had been
assumed by those who had bought land on which
fairs had usually been held, and who were then taking
tolls from merchants which should in justice have
gone to the King. Much curious information was
obtained by means of the inquisitions conducted
under this Act. This was originally recorded in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
<i>Hundred Rolls</i>, and it is made free use of in this
work.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that it is not in the King’s
power to resume a franchise that has been once
granted: so that a fair once authorized by royal
grant, is, by the common law of England, good
against the King. I have found no case wherein
this principle is declared; but there is an instance
which points in a contrary direction: for in 1446-7
(25 Hen. VI.) it was enacted “that all grants of
franchises, markets, fairs, and other liberties to buy
or to sell within the towns of North Wales made to
any Welshman before this time, shall be void and
of no effect.” Here it was parliament, not the
King, revoking the grants. For further legislation
regarding Welsh Fairs, see Chapter V., anno 1534.</p>

<p>Brady (in his famous work on “Boroughs”)
seemed to be of opinion that every free borough had
the privilege of a market and fair, with free right
to come and go thereto and therefrom, as of course
(p. 33, ed. 1777). But I discover no such inherent
right, and where this privilege is sustained it has
usually been included in one of its early charters.
Certainly the converse is not the case: that is to say,
it was in no way customary that fairs should be
limited to boroughs free or otherwise. Many were,
indeed, granted to small towns, frequently to lords
of manors, and commonly to religious houses; and
in various cases to individuals.</p>

<p>In the next chapter I shall examine more in detail
the regulations upon our statute rolls regarding
fairs.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It has been attributed to Alfred the
Great that amongst the many wise and
beneficial measures he took for the
advancement of this kingdom, was the
establishment of fairs and markets. I have already
shown that this is not quite so; but certain it is
that the first general measures for the regulation of
commerce in England, are dated back to his reign.
Hence it was then provided that alien merchants
should come only to the “four fairs,” and should
not remain in England more than forty days. This
was in the latter half of the ninth century. But I
have already shown that fairs were held in other
parts of Europe, and in Asia, centuries earlier than
this date. The point of importance in the regulation
of Alfred is that foreign merchants were permitted
by royal authority to attend these English
fairs.</p>

<p>King Ethelred II. (end of tenth and commencement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
of eleventh centuries) proclaimed that the <i>ships
of merchants, or of enemies from the high seas, coming
with goods into any port should be at peace</i>. The
principle here enunciated, of commerce being deemed
an act of peace, is believed to be of high antiquity
in Great Britain; but whether it originated here is
by no means clear, nor is it material to determine.
At later periods the practice has not been continuously
upheld.</p>

<p>Henry I. granted to the citizens of London (<i>inter
alia</i>) that they should be free throughout England
and the sea ports from <i>toll</i>, passage through towns,
ports, gates, and bridges; <i>and lestage, or a toll paid
for freedom to sell at Fairs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Magna Charta</i> (1215).—The demand of the
Barons presented to King John embodied the following:
“That merchants shall have safety to go
and come, buy and sell, without any evil tolls, but
by antient and honest customs.” In the completed
<i>Charter</i> the actual grant took the following shape:</p>

<p>All merchants shall have safety and security in
coming into England and going out of England, and
in staying and in travelling through England, as well
by land as by water, to buy and sell without any
unjust exactions, according to ancient and right
customs, excepting in time of war, and if they be of
a country at war against us: and if such are found
in our land at the beginning of a war, they shall be
apprehended without injury of their bodies and goods
until it be known to us, or to our Chief Justiciary,
how the merchants of our country are treated who
are found in the country at war against us; if ours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
be in safety there, the others shall be in safety in
our land.</p>

<p>The doctrine of international reciprocity is here
very clearly stated.</p>

<p>Macpherson (“Annals of Commerce”) is of opinion,
after an examination of the trading of the chief
commercial ports of Great Britain, that by the
middle of the twelfth century (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1156) “the
foreign trade was almost entirely conducted by
foreign merchants;” indeed he declared it to be
“evidently” so. I expect to be able to show that
the great centres of trade at this period were the
fairs held in various parts of the kingdom. The
case of <i>Sturbridge Fair</i> (Cambridge) is a remarkable
instance.</p>

<p>1216.—The first Great Charter of Henry III.
confirmed the provisions of <i>Magna Charta</i> as to
merchants, except in the case of those <i>who had been
before publicly prohibited</i>. The privileges thus
accorded to foreign merchants were seven. (1)
To come into England (2) To depart thereout (3)
To remain (4) To travel by land or water (5) To
buy and sell (6) To be free of evil tolls<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (7) To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
enjoy the ancient customs. This last was of
material consequence, and implied privileges not
common to ordinary persons. The promise of freedom
from “evil tolls” hardly less so, as will hereafter
appear.</p>

<p>These early privileges accorded to foreign merchants
who visited our shores seem so natural to us,
in these free-trade times, that we have a difficulty
in realizing at the first glance the full measure of
their significance. It may aid us in doing so if I
review the general regulations regarding foreigners
which prevailed (reciprocally) in most of the countries
of Europe prior to this period (thirteenth century)
and in many cases long thereafter. Every
foreigner was answerable to the debts, and even
crimes of all other foreigners of his own nationality<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the question of nationality was very freely interpreted
in some such cases. And in the case of
the death of a foreign merchant his property in
possession was either forfeited to the King or fell a
prey to the rapacity of the lord of the soil in whose
territory the death occurred.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Further, by an
early custom of London, merchants giving reference
for strangers, who purchased goods on the credit of
such references, were held liable to pay for the
goods so obtained. Thus under the custom of
merchants, two persons of the same nationality being
found in arrear, the whole debt might be charged
to one of them—as the creditor might select!</p>

<p>These restrictions removed, or greatly modified,
it is no wonder that fairs greatly increased in
numbers and importance.</p>

<p>1235. This same monarch Henry III. gave special
permission to the merchants of <i>Cologne</i> to attend
fairs in all parts of England. This was probably
in consequence of some claim from the branch of
the Hanseatic League established in London, to
trade in its corporate capacity exclusively for the
cities which belonged to the confederacy. There was
another association of German merchants settled in
London at this date.</p>

<p>1275. The First statute of Westminster (c. 23)
was intended to remedy the state of primitive
justice already spoken of, and which to a large
degree arose out of local jurisdictions. Under it no
foreign person—that is to say, one who was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
free of the town he visited—which is of this realm
(<i>i.e.</i> of England) was to be distrained for any debts
but his own in any city, burgh, town, market or fair.</p>

<p>1283. The statute <i>de Mercatoribus</i> (11 Edw. I.)
was intended to assist merchants in the recovery of
their debts, and thus to encourage them to trade in
England. When they supplied goods and the debt
was acknowledged before royal officers in specified
towns, they could be empowered under the King’s
seal to distrain for debt in default of payment. At
Acton Burnel this new scheme was determined on,
for trial in London, York, and Bristol; and after
two years it was decreed (<i>Statutum Mercatorum</i>,
1285, 13 Edw. I.) that it should be brought into
much more extensive operation by giving similar
facilities in many other places, especially in <i>fairs</i>,
and a much greater number of royal officers were
empowered to act in the matter. These privileges
were not limited to men from particular towns or
countries: all foreign merchants could avail themselves
thereof, except when this kingdom was at
war with their native land. The clause relating to
the “Seal of the Fair” was as follows:—</p>

<p>“And a Seal shall be provided that shall serve
for Fairs, and the same shall be sent unto every Fair
under the King’s Seal, by a Clerk sworn, or by the
Keeper of the Fair, and the Seal shall be opened before
them, and the one piece shall be delivered unto
the aforesaid merchants, and the other shall remain
with the Clerk; and before them, or one of the merchants,
if both cannot attend, the Recognizances
shall be taken as before is said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>In the case of London two merchants of the
Commonalty should be chosen that should swear
compliance with this law.</p>

<p>And by a charter of the following year granted
to foreign merchants then resident in England, it was
ordained, “that one weight shall be kept in every
fair and town; that the weigher shall show the
buyer and seller that the beam and scales are fair,
and that there shall be <i>only one weight and measure</i> in
our dominions, and that they be stamped with our
standard mark.” All students of history, know how
well this ordinance has been observed!</p>

<p>By the Statute of Wynton [Winchester] attributed
to the reign of Edw. I., but probably of
earlier date it is enacted (c. 6) “And the King
commandeth and forbiddeth that from henceforth
neither Fairs nor markets be kept in the <i>Church-yards</i>
for the Honour of the Church.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>1321. About this date—reign of Edw. II.—there
is supposed to have been enacted “Articles of the
Office of Escheatry.” Amongst the duties of this
officer of the crown, he was to hold inquest (<i>inter
alia</i>) of markets, fairs, tolls, passage-monies, and
customs, unjustly levied without license of the
King; also where, when, and from what time, and
how much they are worth by the year. Under the
power so granted various inquisitions regarding
fairs, and the tolls charged, and the privileges
asserted, were conducted.</p>

<p class="dropcap">These have been already referred to,
and will arise in various other parts of
this work, as being closely associated
with fairs.</p>

<p>These Courts, designated in the Latin tongue <i>curia
pedis pulverizati</i>, in the Old French <i>pied puldreaux</i>,
alike in each case, it is supposed, in reference to, or
as typical of the dusty feet of the suitors. Some
indeed say because “justice is there done as speedily
as dust can fall from the feet.” But without reference
to such fanciful derivations they may be spoken
of as a rough-and-ready mode of administering justice
at fairs, markets, &amp;c. There is no record or
ordinance by which any such Court was called into
existence in this country. They came to us with
fairs; they passed away with the decay of the commercial
usages of fairs.</p>

<p>Those curious in matters of archæology may consult
a paper hereon by Dr. Pettingall, which appears
in “Archæologia,” i. pp. 190-203.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Barrington, in his “Observations on the Statutes,”
observes that “In the Burrow Laws of Scotland, an
alien merchant is called Piedpuldreaux, and likewise
ane Farand-man, or a man who frequents fairs.
The Court of Piepowder is, therefore, to determine
disputes between those who resort to fairs and
these kind of Pedlars who generally attend them.
<i>Pied puldreaux</i> in Old French signifies a Pedlar, who
gets his livelihood by vending his goods where he
can, without any certain or fixed residence.”</p>

<p>In the “Regiam Majestatem,” 1609, there is the
following: “Gif ane stranger merchand travelland
throw the Realme, havand na land, nor residence,
nor dwelling within the schirefdome, bot vaigand
fra ane place to ane other, quha therefore is called
Pied Puldreaux, or dustifute.”</p>

<p>Hence then the Court of Pie Powder signifies in
simple language a <i>Court of Pedlars</i>.</p>

<p>Such Courts were held in the markets of the
Romans, as they were in the markets of the Normans,
and probably all through the old Roman
Europe. But they had yet an earlier origin.
Demosthenes makes it plain that all causes relating
to the festival of Bacchus were heard on the spot.
Fairs were associated with the Olympic games; and
it seems clear descended from the festivities of the
Greek Church.</p>

<p>The necessity in all fairs of a tribunal which could
promptly deal with the differences arising amongst
a fleeting population were the same, quite irrespective
of where the fair might chance to be held. Again
the merchants attending the principal fairs of different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
countries were in a large degree the same.
They travelled from country to country. What
they found beneficial in one part of the globe was
equally so in another, and hence became adopted as
of course. The tribunals of commerce which once
existed in England, and which still exist in various
parts of Continental Europe, are analagous to the
Courts of Piepowder held at fairs.</p>

<p>In an account of a fair held in the northern
region of Lapland as far back as two centuries ago
(1681), a Court of Piepowder is recorded as one of
its features.</p>

<p>The peculiar constitution of the Court has to be
kept firmly in view. It had jurisdiction only in
commercial questions. It tried them before a jury
of traders formed on the spot. It could entertain a
case of slander, if of merchandise or wares exhibited,
but not of the merchant or trader who vended the
same. It could sit only during fair time; could
take cognizance only of things happening during
fair time, and within the fair. It could try a thief
who had committed robbery in the fair only when
he had been captured within its bounds. It might
hold pleas for amounts, in later times, above forty
shillings; and its judgments could be deferred and
enforced at the next fair. So firmly indeed had
custom defined the powers of these Courts, that it
has been well said, even the King himself if he were
sitting as judge in such a Court, could not extend
them.</p>

<p><i>Specific Legislation.</i>—1478. There having been
many abuses committed in the Courts <i>Piepowder</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
held at the fairs in England, chiefly by the avarice
and injustice of their stewards, bailiffs, and others,
whose province it was to hold the courts and administer
impartial justice in all cases arising during
the continuance, and within the jurisdiction, of the
fairs: but who took cognizance of contracts and
trespasses unconnected with the fairs, and frequently
having no foundation in truth. These abuses began
to have the effect of preventing merchants from
attending the fairs: whereby the people of the
country were deprived of the convenience of purchasing
goods; and the lords of the fairs lost their
customary profits. The entire subject came before
parliament, and a measure intended for relief resulted,
which I shall now review in detail:</p>

<p>17 Edw. IV. c. 2.—<i>Item</i>, Whereas divers Fairs be
holden &amp; kept in this Realm, some by Prescription
allowed before Justices in Eyre, &amp; some by grant
of our Lord the King that now is, &amp; some by the
grant of his noble Progenitors &amp; Predecessors, &amp;
to every of the same Fairs is of right pertaining a
Court of Pypowders, to minister in the same due
Justice in this behalf; in wʰ Court it hath been all
times accustomed, that every person coming to the sᵈ
Fairs shᵈ have lawful remedy of all manner of Contracts,
Trespasses, Covenants, Debts, &amp; other Deeds
under or done within any of the same Fairs, during
the time of the same Fairs, &amp; within the jurisdiction
of the same, &amp; to be tried by merchants being of
the same Fair; wʰ Courts at this day be misused by
Stewards....</p>

<p>And sometimes, by the device of evil disposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
people several suits be feigned to trouble them to
whom they bear evil will, to the intent that they
for Lucre may have favorable Inquests of those
that come to the sᵈ Fairs, where they take their
actions ... whereby the Lords of the same Fairs
do lose great profit by the not coming of divers
merchants to the fairs ... &amp; also the Commons be
unserved of such stuff &amp; merchandise as wᵈ otherwise
come to the said Fairs.</p>

<p>For remedy whereof it was Ordained &amp; Established
that from the first day of May then next ensuing no
Steward, Under-steward, Bailiff, Commissary, nor
other minister of any such Courts of Pypowders
should hold plea upon any action at the Suit of any
person or persons, unless the Plaintiff or plaintiffs,
or his or their attorney, in the presence of the defendant
or defendants do swear upon the holy
Evangelists, upon the Declaration, that the Contract
or other Deed contained in the sᵈ Declaration
was made or committed within the Fair &amp; within the
Time of the sᵈ Fair where he taketh his action, &amp;
within the bounds &amp; jurisdiction of the same Fair.
The Defendant might plead that the cause did not
arise out of the Fair. If the plaintiff refused to
swear the defendant shᵈ be quit. The penalty on
a Steward for holding a Court contrary to this act
100½ shillings. This act to be Proclaimed, &amp; was
to continue until the first day of the next Parliament
“Provided always, That this act nor anything comprised
in the same act be hurtful &amp; prejudicial to
William now Bishop of Durham, nor to his successors
within the Liberty &amp; Franchise of the Bishoprick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of Durham.” This act was amended in slight
details by 1 Rich. III. c. 6 (1483). See Chap. V.</p>

<p><i>Appeal.</i>—1779. By the 19 George III. c. 70
right of appeal was given against the judgments
of any of the inferior courts—and hence against those
of the Courts of Piepowder—by means of a writ of
error to the superior courts at Westminster; and
such courts were to have the right of issuing writs
of execution in aid of their processes after judgment
not appealed against. This largely extended the
efficacy of this particular court, as goods of the
defendant—not in the fair, and therefore beyond the
ancient jurisdiction of this court—could now be
levied upon.</p>

<p class="dropcap">There was enacted 2 Edwᵈ.
III. c. 15. “No person shall keep a Fair longer
than he ought to do,” which was as follows:</p>

<p>Item, it is established That it shall be commanded
to all the sheriffs of England &amp; elsewhere,
where need shall require to cry and publish within
Liberties &amp; without, that all the Lords [of the soil]
wʰ have Fairs, be it for yielding certain Ferm
[Rent?] for the same to the King or otherwise,

them by the King’s Charter granted them, for the
time limited by the sᵈ Charters (2) and also they
that have them without Charter, for the time that
they ought to hold them of Right. (3) And that
every Lord at the beginning of his Fair shall there
do cry &amp; publish how long the fair shall endure, to
the intent that merchants shall not be at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Fairs over the time so published, upon pain to be
greviously punished towards the King (4) Nor the
sᵈ Lords shall not hold them over the due Time
upon pain to seize the Fairs into the King’s hands,
there to remain till they have made a fine to the
King for the offence, after it be duly found, that
the Lords held the same Fairs longer than they
ought, or that the merchants have sitten above the
time so cried &amp; published. See 1331.</p>

<p>1331. The 5 Edw. III. c. 5—“The Penalty if
any do sell Ware at a Fair after it is ended” was
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, Where it is contained in the statute made
at Northampton [1328] ... that the Lords wʰ
have Fairs by Charters or otherwise, shall hold them
during the Time that they ought to do, &amp; no
longer upon Pain to seize such Fairs into the King’s
hands (2) &amp; that every Lord at the Beginning
of his Fair <i>shall proclaim how long the fair shall
endure</i>; (3) and in the same Statute is no certain
punishment ordained against the merchants if they
sell after the time, (4) it is accorded, That the sᵈ merchants
after the sᵈ time shall close their Booths &amp;
Stalls without putting any manner of Ware or Merchandise
to sell there. (5) And if it be found, that
any merchant from henceforth sell any Ware or merchandise
at the sᵈ Fairs after the sᵈ Time, such Merchant
shall forfeit to me Lord the King the double
value of that wʰ is sold (6) and every Man that
will sue for our Lord the King, shall be received, &amp;
shall have the fourth part of that wʰ shall be lost at
his suit.</p>

<p>Macpherson [“Hist. of Commerce”] commenting
upon this act says <i>Fairs were “the seats of most
of the inland trade of the kingdom.”</i></p>

<p>1448. The 27 Henry VI. c. 5 was directed against
“the scandal of holding Fairs &amp; markets on Sundays
&amp; upon High Feast Days.” This practice
had in earlier times been very general.</p>

<p><i>Attempted Limitation of the Commerce of Fairs.</i>—1487.
The Common Council of London, in order to
oblige the people to resort to the City for their purchases,
had made an ordinance that no citizen should
carry goods for sale to any fair or market out of
the city. The assortment of goods in London (says
Macpherson) appears to have been so commanding
that those interested in fairs of Salisbury, Bristol,
Oxford, Cambridge, Nottingham, Ely, Coventry,
and other places, and also the people of the country
in general, were alarmed, and represented to Parliament
the destruction of the fairs, and the great
hardship of being obliged to travel to London to
procure chalices, books, vestments, and other church
ornaments, and also victuals for the time of Lent,
linen cloth, woollen cloth, brass, pewter, bedding,
osmond, iron, flax, wax, and other necessaries. The
London ordinance was thereupon annulled by Parliament;
and the citizens were permitted to go
with their goods to the fairs and markets in every
part of England. (“Hist. of Com.” i. p. 708.)</p>

<p>The act by which this was effected is 3 Hen.
VII. c. 9—<i>Freemen of London may carry their wares
to any Fairs or Markets</i>—which recites as follows:</p>

<p>“Humbly showen and prayen unto your Highness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
your true &amp; faithful Commons of this your
Realm of <i>England</i>, That where the Citizens
&amp; Freemen of the City of London have used out
of time &amp; mind to go, carry &amp; lede their merchandise
&amp; ware unto all Fairs &amp; markets at their
Liberty of the sᵈ City; now of late time the Mayor,
Aldermen, &amp; Citizens of the City of <i>London</i> have
made &amp; enacted an Ordinance within the same City,
upon a great Pain, that no man that is a freeman or
a Citizen of the sᵈ City shall go or come to any Fair
or Market out of the same City of London, with
any manner of ware or merchandise to sell or to
barter, to this Intent, that all Buyers &amp; merchants
should resort to the sᵈ City to buy their ware
&amp; merchandises of the sᵈ Citizens &amp; Freemen of
London aforesaid, because of their singular Lucre
&amp; Avail; wʰ Ordinance, if it should hold as is

Wax, &amp; many other necessary Things, the wʰ
might not be forborn amongst your said liege
People; but, by the sᵈ Ordinance every man
willing to buy any of the premisses, shall be courted
to come to the sᵈ City of London, to their importable
Costs &amp; Charges, wʰ if the sᵈ act should endure,
shall grow great hurt &amp; prejudice to the
common weal of this your Realm, &amp; shall cause
many pernicious strifes &amp; debates between your
said liege people, &amp; the said Mayor, Aldermen &amp;
Citizens in time to come, by the making the sᵈ
Ordinance, the wʰ is thought may not continue
&amp; stand with good charity, the premisses considered,
wherefore it may please your said Highness
most noble &amp; abundant Grace, in consideration
of the Hurt likely to grow of &amp; by the
premises, that it may be enacted:</p>

<p>The King Lords and Commons therefore enacted
that every freeman and citizen of London then
or thereafter, might go with his victual ware or
merchandise, at his or their liberty to any fair or
market that should please him within the realm of
England, any act, statute or ordinance to the contrary
notwithstanding. Any disregard of the statute
to incur a penalty of £10 to the king.</p>

<p>1496. The Company of Merchant-Adventurers
of England which was said to have been in existence
for nearly two centuries—although not actually
chartered until 1505—took steps about this
period calculated to interfere with the freedom of
British merchants to attend fairs and marts in
foreign countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>The merchants who traded on their own individual
account residing in various parts of England
and of the City of London, sent up a petition to
the House of Commons, (as against the claims of
the said Company of Merchant-Adventurers) wherein
it was set forth that they traded beyond the sea with
their goods and merchandise, as well into Spain,
Portugal, Bretagne, Ireland, Normandy, France,
Seville, Venice, Dantzic, Eastland, Friseland and
many other parts—the geography is often a little
hazy in these early documents—there to buy and
sell and make their exchanges, according to the laws
and customs of those parts: every one trading as
seemed most to his advantage, without sanction,
fine, imposition or contribution, to be had or
taken of them, or any of them, to for, or by, any
English person or persons. And in like sort they,
before this time had used, and of right ought to
have and use the like commerce into the coasts of
<i>Flanders</i>, <i>Zealand</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Brabant</i>, and other adjacent
parts, under the obedience of the Archduke
of Burgundy; in which places are usually kept the
universal marts or fairs, four times in the year; to
which marts all Englishmen, and divers other nations
in times past, have used to resort, there to sell their
own commodities, and freely to buy such merchandise
as they had occasion for: till now of late, the
Fellowship of Mercers, and other merchants and adventurers,
dwelling and being free within the City
of London by confederacy amongst themselves, for
their own singular profit, contrary to every Englishman’s
liberty, to the liberty of the said mart there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and contrary to all law, reason, charity, right and
conscience have made an ordinance among themselves
to the prejudice of all other Englishmen, that
no Englishman resorting to the said mart, shall either
buy or sell any merchandise there, unless he shall
first have compounded and made fine with the said
Fellowship of Merchants of London, at their pleasure;
upon pain of forfeiture to the said Fellowship
of such their said merchandise. Which fine, imposition,
and exaction, at the beginning, when first
taken, was demanded by colour of the <i>Fraternity
of St. Thomas Becket</i>; at which time it was only an
old noble sterling. And so by colour of such feigned
holiness, it hath been suffered to be taken of a few
years past: it was afterwards increased to 100 shillings,
Flemish; but now the said Fellowship of
London take of every Englishman or young merchant,
being there, at his first coming £40 sterling
for a fine, to suffer him to buy, and sell his own
goods. By reason whereof, all merchants not of
the said Fellowship, do withdraw themselves from
the said marts: whereby the woollen cloth of this
realm, which is one of the greatest commodities of
the same, as well as sundry other English commodities
of the same, as well as sundry other English
commodities, are not sold and got off as in times
past, but are for want of sale thereof, in divers parts,
where such clothes are made, conveyed to London,
and there sold at an undervalued price, even below
what they cost the makers. Moreover the merchandise
of those foreign parts, imported by the
said Fellowship, is sold to your complainants and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
other subjects at so high a price that the buyers cannot
live thereupon; by reason whereof all the cities
and towns of the realm are falling into great
poverty, ruin and decay: and the King’s customs
and subsidies, and the navy of the land greatly
decreased.</p>

<p>It was therefore enacted (12 Hen. VII. c. 6) that all
Englishmen from henceforth should and might freely
resort to the Coasts of <i>Flanders</i>, <i>Holland</i>, Zealand,
Brabant, and other parts adjoining, under the obedience
of the Archduke; and at their marts or fairs
there, sell their merchandise freely, without exaction,
fine, imposition, or contribution taken or received of
any of them by the said Fraternity or Fellowship,
excepting only the sum of ten marks [£6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>]
sterling, on pain of forfeiting £20 for every time
they take more; and shall also forfeit to the person
so imposed on ten times so much as contrary to this
act was taken of him. See 1554.</p>

<p><i>Welsh Fairs.</i>—1534. There was enacted 26
Hen. VIII. c. 6—<i>The Bill concerning Councils in
Wales</i>—which recited: “Forasmuch as the people
of <i>Wales</i>, &amp; the marches of the same, not dreading

fixed in the same People, that they be not like to
cease unless some sharp correction &amp; Punishment
for Redress &amp; Amputation of the Premises be
provided, according to the Demerits of the
offenders.” Whereupon it was enacted (<i>inter
alia</i>):</p>

<p>That no person or persons dwelling or resident
within <i>Wales</i> or the Lordships marches of the same,
of what Estate, Degree, or Condition soever he or they
be of, coming, resorting, or repairing unto any
Sessions or Court to be holden within <i>Wales</i> or any
Lordships, marches, of the same shall bring or bear,
or cause to be brought or born to the same Sessions
or Court or to any place within the distance of two
miles from the same Sessions or Court, nor to any
Town, Church, <i>Fair</i>, Market or other congregation,
except it be upon a Hute or Outcry made of any
Felony or Robbery done or perpetrated, nor in the
Highways in affray of the King’s Peace, or the
Kings liege People, any Bill, Long-bow, Cross-bow,
Hand-gun, Sword, Staff, Dagger, Halbert, More-spike,
Spear, or any other manner of weapon,
Proof-coat or Armour defensive, upon pain of forfeiture
of the same and of imprisonment and fine,
except permission by given by the proper authorities
authorised thereto.</p>

<p><i>Robberies in Fairs.</i>—1552. The 5 and 6 Edw.
VI. c. 9—<i>An Act for the taking away of the Benefit
of Clergy</i> for certain offenders recites: (3) “And
where also it hath been in question &amp; doubted,
that if such Robberies &amp; Felonies happen to be
committed &amp; done in any Booth or Booths, Tent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
or Tents in any Fair or market, the Owner of the
same, his wife, Children or Servants happening
to be within the same at the time of the committing
of such Felonies, &amp; put in fear &amp; dread,
the offenders therein being found guilty after the
Laws of this Realm, should not lose the Benefit
of Clergy.”</p>

<p>Whereupon it was enacted that persons so offending
should not be entitled to benefit of Clergy, but
should suffer death in such manner and form as was
mentioned in the act 23 Hen. VIII. c. 1, for Robberies
and Felonies committed and done in Dwelling
houses and Dwelling places, the Owner and Dweller
in the same, his wife children or servants being
within the same, and put in fear and dread, without
having any respect or consideration whether the
owner or dweller in such booths and tents his wife,
children or servants being in the same Booths or
Tents at the time of such Robberies and Felonies
committed, shall be sleeping or waking.</p>

<p><i>Restricting the dealing in Fairs.</i>—1554. By the
1st and 2nd Philip and Mary, c. 7—<i>An Act for that
Persons dwelling in the Country shall not sell divers
Wares in Cities or Towns Corporate by retail</i>—it is
recited: Where before this time the ancient Cities,
Boroughs, Towns Corporate and market Towns
(within this Realm of <i>England</i>) have been very
populous, and chiefly inhabited with merchants,
Artificers, and Handicraftsmen, during which time
the Children in those Cities were civilly brought up
and instructed, and also the said cities &amp;c. kept in
good order and obesience, and the inhabiters of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
same well set on work and kept from idleness. (2)
By reason whereof, the said Cities &amp;c. did then
prosper in riches and great wealth, and were as then
not only able to serve and furnish the King and
Queens majesties, and their noble progenitors, Kings
of this Realm, as well with great numbers of good
able persons and well furnished, meet for the wars,
as also then charged, and yet chargeable with great
fee-farms, <i>Quindismes</i>, Taxes, and divers other
payments to the King and Queen’s Majesties, which
at this present they be not able to pay and bear, but
to their utter Undoing, being few in number to pay
and bear the same; but also the same Cities &amp;c.
are likely to come very shortly to utter destruction,
ruin and decay; (3) by reason whereof the occupiers,
Linendrapers, woollen-drapers, Haberdashers
and Grocers dwelling in the Counties out of the
said Cities &amp;c. do not only occupy the art and
mystery of the said Sciences in the places where
they dwell and inhabit, but also come into the said
Cities &amp;c. and there sell their wares, and take away
the Relief of the inhabitants of the said Cities &amp;c.
to the great decay and utter undoing of the inhabitants
of the same, if speedy reformation therein be
not had in time convenient. (4) For remedy
whereof and for the better amendment of the said
Cities &amp;c. to the end that the same Cities &amp;c. may
be better able to pay the said Fee-farms, and also
to bear the other ordinary charges within the same
Cities &amp;c. and to furnish the King and Queen’s
majesties with numbers of able persons, like as they
have heretofore done in times past, in times of War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>It was enacted, That any person or persons which
do now inhabit and dwell, or hereafter shall inhabit
and dwell in the Country anywhere, or County
within this Realm of <i>England</i>, out of any of the
said Cities, Boroughs, Towns Corporate or Market
Towns, from and after the Feast of St. <i>Michael</i> the
archangel next coming, <i>shall not sell or cause to be
sold by retail</i>, any woollen cloth, Linen Cloth,
Haberdashery wares, Grocery wares, Mercery wares,
at or within any of the said Cities &amp;c., or within
the Suburbs or Liberties of the said Cities, &amp;c.,
within the said Realm of England (<i>except it be in
open Fairs</i>) upon pain of forfeiting 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and the
whole Wares so sold, proffered and offered to be
sold contrary to the form and intent of this act as
above is said. But all such persons might sell their
products wholesale; and persons dwelling in the
Country, but afterwards becoming free of any City
&amp;c. would be thus placed outside the operation of
this act. And persons might sell by retail all
manner of Cloth, Linen or Woollen of our making
anywhere notwithstanding this act. “Provided
alway that this act or anything therein contained
shall not be prejudicial or hurtful to the Liberties
and Privileges of the Universities of <i>Cambridge</i> and
<i>Oxford</i>, or either of them.”</p>

<p><i>Horse Fairs.</i>—1555. The 2 and 3 Philip and
Mary, c. 7 related to the facilities for dealing in
stolen horses, which it was attempted to check by
having duly appointed fairs for such dealings.
This Act gave rise to the holding of “Horse Fairs”
separately from other fairs. The Act 31 of Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
c. 12 (1589) required a record to be kept of
all horses sold at fairs.</p>

<p><i>Plague.</i>—1625. The importance rightly attached
from a sanitary point of view to the gathering of
large multitudes together at fairs is manifested
in a very ample degree in a Royal Proclamation
issued by Charles I. from his Palace at Woodstock
on the 4th August:</p>

<p>The Kings most excellent majesty, out of his
Princely and Christian care of his loving subjects,
that no good means of Providence may be neglected
to stay the further spreading of the great infection
of the Plague, doth find it necessary to prevent all
occasions of public concourse of his people for the
present, till it shall please Almighty God of His
goodness, to cease the violence of the Contagion
which is very dispersed into many parts of the Kingdom
already; <i>And therefore remembering that there
are at hand two Fairs of special note and unto which
there is usually extraordinary resort out of all
parts of the Kingdom</i>, the one kept in Smithfield,
near the City of London, called Bartholomew Fair,
and the other near Cambridge called Stourbridge
Fair, <i>the holding whereof at the usual times would in
all likelihood be the occasion of further danger and
infection in other parts of the land</i>, which yet in
Gods mercy stand clear and free, hath, with the
advice of his Majesty’s Privy Council, thought
good, by this open declaration of his pleasure and
necessary commandment, not only to admonish and
require all his loving subjects to forbear to resort
for this time to either of the said two fairs, or <i>to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
any other fairs within 50 miles of the said City of
London</i>, but also to enjoin the Lords of the said
Fairs, and others interested in them, or any of them,
that they all forbear to hold the said Fairs, or anything
appertaining so them, at all times accustomed
or at any time, till by God’s goodness and mercy
the infection of the Plague shall cease, or be so
much diminished, that his majesty shall give order
for holding them; upon pain of such punishment
as, for a contempt so much concerning the universal
safety of his people, they shall be adjudged to deserve,
which they must expect to be inflicted with
all severity: His Majesty desire being so intentive
for preventing the general Infection threatened, as
he is resolved to spare no man that shall be the
cause of dispersing the same. And to that purpose
doth hereby further charge and enjoin, under like
penalty, all citizens and inhabitants of the said City
of London, <i>that none of them shall repair to any fair
held within any part of his kingdom</i>, until it shall
please God to cease the infection now reigning
amongst them: His Majesty’s intention being, and
so hereby declaring himself, that no Lord of any
Fairs, or others interested in the profits thereof,
shall by this necessary and temporary restraint, receive
any prejudice in the right of his or their Fairs,
or liberties thereunto belonging, anything before
mentioned notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Earlier proclamations and orders had prevented
the holding or had curtailed the period of St. Bartholomew
fairs on several occasions viz. 1348, 1593,
and 1603; and other fairs had likewise been stayed or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
postponed. These will be noticed in dealing with
such fairs specifically.</p>

<p>1630. The Plague was prevailing in Cambridge,
and a Royal Proclamation was issued, dated Aug. 1,
prohibiting the holding of the “three great Fairs of
special note, unto which there is an extraordinary
resort from all parts of the Kingdom” viz. those
of Bartholomew, Sturbridge, and Southwark.</p>

<p><i>Coinage.</i>—1662. The preceding year was that of
the Restoration, and it was by Proclamation ordered
that the coinage of the Commonwealth should be
no longer current than the last day of November.
The “Kingdom’s Intelligencer” for Aug. 22-25
this year contained the following: “Whitehall
Aug. 23. There hath been a discovery of divers
persons who have coined both gold and silver, and
of other persons who have vended the same in great
quantities &amp;c. intending to utter the same to
Clothiers and at Fairs; which is published to an
end that honest persons may not be deceived by
receiving such monies.”</p>

<p><i>Sale of Printed Matter, &amp;c.</i>—1698. In the 9
and 10 William III. c. 27—<i>An Act for Licensing
Hawkers and Pedlars</i> &amp;c. section 9 is as follows:
Provided always.... That this Act or anything
contained shall not Extend to Prohibit any persons
from selling of any Acts of Parliament, Forms of
Prayer, Proclamations, Gazettes, licensed Almanacks
or other Printed Papers, licensed by authority,
or any Fish, Fruits or Victuals; nor to hinder
any person or persons, who are the real workers or
makers of any Goods or Wares within the Kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of <i>England</i>, Dominion of <i>Wales</i>, and Town of <i>Berwick</i>
upon <i>Tweed</i>, or his her or their Children,
Apprentices, Agents or Servants, to such real
Workers and makers of such Goods or Wares only,
from carrying abroad, exposing to Sale, or selling
any of the said Goods and Wares of his, her, or
their, own making in any Public Mart, Fairs,
Markets, or Elsewhere; nor any Tinkers, Coopers,
Glaziers, Plummers, Harness-menders, or other
persons actually trading in mending kettles, Tubs,
Household Goods or Harness whatsoever, from
going about and carrying with them proper materials
for mending the same.</p>

<p>And by Section 12 it is further enacted: That
nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed
to extend to hinder any person or persons
from Selling or exposing to sale any sorts of Goods
or Merchandises, in any public mart, Market, or
Fair within the Kingdom of <i>England</i>, Dominion of
<i>Wales</i> and Town of <i>Berwick</i> upon <i>Tweed</i>, but that
such person or persons may do therein as they lawfully
might have done before the making of this
act; anything herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>

<p><i>Altering the Calendar.</i>—1751. Under 24 Geo. II.
c. 23—<i>An Act for Regulating the Commencement of
the Year; and for correcting the Calendar now in
use</i>, it was provided Section 4 (<i>inter alia</i>) that the
terms for holding and keeping of all markets, fairs
and marts, “whether for the sale of Goods or
Cattle, or for the hiring of Servants, or for any
other purpose, wʰ are either fixed to certain nominal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
days of the month, or depending upon the beginning,
or any certain day of any month, &amp; all
Courts incident &amp; belonging to, or usually holden
or kept with any such Fairs or Marts, should be
holden &amp; kept upon or according to the same
natural days upon or according to wʰ the same shᵈ
have been so kept or holden in case this act had not
been made.”</p>

<p>This act was amended by 25 Geo. II. c. 30,
which enacted that all such events as before enumerated
were to take place “according to the new
Calendar.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the 2nd and 3rd Vict. c. 47—<i>An Act
for the Further Improving the Police in
and near the Metropolis</i>—it is provided
that Inquiries may be made regarding
Fairs within the Metropolitan Police District, alike
as to the authority to hold such Fair, and also as to
the time during which it may be holden. If the
authority for holding the Fair be doubtful the
owner or occupier of the ground may be summoned
to show his right and title to hold such Fair: and
if the Fair be declared unlawful, then Booths &amp;c.
may be removed. But the owner or occupier by
entering into recognizances, may reserve the question
of the right or title to hold such Fair, to be
tried in the Court of Queen’s Bench—see 1868.</p>

<p>1843. The 6 and 7 Vict. c. 68—<i>An Act for Regulating
Theatres</i>—recites “Whereas it is expedient
that the Laws now in force for regulating
Theatres and Theatrical Performances be repealed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
and other Provisions be enacted in their stead.”
And section 23 is as follows: And be it enacted
that in this act the word “Stage-play” shall be
taken to include every Tragedy, Comedy, Farce,
Opera, Burletta, Interlude, Melodrama, Pantomime,
or other entertainment of the stage, or any part
thereof: Provided always, that nothing herein contained
shall be construed to apply to any Theatrical
Representation in any Booth or Show which by the
Justices of the Peace, or other Persons having
authority in that behalf, shall be allowed in any
lawful Fair, Feast, or customary meeting of the like
kind. This act was only to extend to Great
Britain.</p>

<p>1844. The 7 and 8 Vict. c. 24—<i>An Act for
Abolishing the Offences of Forestalling, Regrating,
and Engrossing, and for repealing certain statutes
passed in Restraint of Trade</i>—enacts (section 4)
“That nothing in this act shall be construed to
apply to the offence of knowingly and fraudulently
spreading or conspiring to spread any false rumour,
with intent to enhance or decry the Price of any
goods or merchandise, or to the offence of preventing
or endeavouring to prevent by Force or
threats any goods, wares, or merchandise being
brought to any Fair or Market, but that every
such offence shall be inquired of, tried, and
punished as if this act had not been made.”</p>

<p>1847. There was enacted 10 and 11 Vict. c. 14—<i>An
Act for consolidating in One Act certain Provisions
usually contained in Acts for Constructing or Regulating
Markets and Fairs</i>—which however was only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to extend to such markets or fairs as should be
authorised by any Act of Parliament hereafter to be
passed, which should declare this Act to be incorporated
therewith; and then all clauses of this Act,
except so far as they might be varied or excepted
from such Act were to apply. The details of this
measure will fall to be reviewed more in detail under
<span class="smcap">Markets</span>.</p>

<p>1868. There was enacted 31 and 32 Vict. c. 51—<i>An
Act to amend the Laws relating to Fairs in England
and Wales</i>—under which “in case it should appear
to the Secretary of State for the Home Department,
upon representation duly made to him by the magistrates
of any Petty Sessional District, within which any
Fair is held, or by the owner of any Fair in England
and Wales, that it would be for the convenience and
advantage of the Public that any such Fair shall be
held in each year on some day or days other than
those on which such Fair is used to be held, it shall be
lawful for the Secretary of State for the Home Department
to order that such Fair shall be held on
such other day or days as he shall think fit.” Provided
notice of such representation be duly advertised,
and also notice of order as therein provided.
(See 1873.)</p>

<p>An act of the same session (c. 12) gave powers to
facilitate the alteration of days upon which and of
places at which fairs might be held in <i>Ireland</i>. It
was upon the same lines as the preceding.</p>

<p>Another measure of the same session (c. 106)—<i>An
Act for the Prevention of the holding of unlawful
Fairs within the Limits of the Metropolitan Police<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
District</i>—provides that where any Fair is holden or
notice given of any Fair proposed to be holden on
any ground within the Metropolitan Police District,
other than that on which a Fair has been holden
during each of the seven years immediately preceding,
it should be competent for the Commissioner
of Police to cause inquiry to be made as to right
and title to hold such Fair, after the manner provided
by the act of 1839. This is designated “The
Metropolitan Fairs Act 1868.”</p>

<p>1871. There was enacted 34 Vict. c. 12—<i>An
Act to further Amend the Law relating to Fairs in
England and Wales</i>—which recites: “Whereas certain
of the Fairs held in England &amp; Wales are
unnecessary, are the cause of grievous immorality,
and are very injurious to the inhabitants of the
Towns in which such Fairs are held, and it is therefore
expedient to make provision to facilitate the
abolition of such Fairs.” It is then provided that the
Secretary of State may on representation of magistrates
with consent of owner, order fairs to be
abolished. The machinery being the same as under
the Act of 1839 applying to the Metropolitan
Police District. This Act is known as “The Fairs
Act, 1871.”</p>

<p>1872. The Local Government Board (Ireland)
Act 1872 gave (35 and 36 Vict. c. 69, section 10)
powers to the governing body of any town, being
the owners of any fair held therein (under the Local
Government (Ireland) Act 1871) with the consent
of two thirds of the members of such governing
body, and with the consent of the Local Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Board—and of any person being the owner of
any fair, with the consent of the last named body—to
alter and fix the days for holding fairs. Notices
being given as therein prescribed.</p>

<p>1873. The Act of 1868 was repealed, but almost
precisely similar provisions were re-enacted by 36
and 37 Vict. c. 37. The term “owner” (used as in
the previous act and in this) was defined to mean
any person or persons, or body of companies, or
body corporate, entitled to hold any fair, whether
in respect of the ownership of any lands or tenements,
or under any charter, letters patent, or otherwise
howsoever.</p>

<p>This measure was not to apply to <i>Scotland</i> or
<i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>1874. There are a great number of acts relating
to the sale of Intoxicating Liquors at Fairs and
Races. The latest 37 and 38 Vict. c. 49 (1874) by
section 18, enacts that “occasional Licences” are
required in all such cases, except where the ordinary
licensed premises fall within the boundaries of such
fair or race ground.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The origin of this Fair—like that of
most of the great fairs of the world—is
involved in obscurity. The first
trace of it is found in a charter granted
about 1211 by King John to the Lepers of the
Hospital of St. Mary Magdalen at Sturbridge, by
Cambridge—a fair to be held in the Close of the
Hospital on the Vigil and Feast of the Holy
Cross.</p>

<p>The Commissioners appointed by Edward I. to
make inquiry into the rights and revenue of the
Crown, visited Cambridge; and concerning its
several markets and fairs reported (<i>inter alia</i>) the
existence of this fair to which fact I shall make further
reference, under date 1278.</p>

<p>Whatever its origin, it became in a comparatively
short time after the period of which I am now
speaking the most important fair held in Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Britain, and some writers have declared—without
much apparent information to guide them—in the
world. The incidents in its history are so remarkable,
and throw so much light upon the customs of our
forefathers, that I propose to give them in considerable
detail. They have been brought together from
various sources—the chief being Cooper’s “Annals
of Cambridge,” compiled by Charles Henry Cooper,
F.S.A., who held the office of Town Clerk, and
who consequently had unrestricted access to the records.
The “History and Antiquities of Barnwell
Abbey,” 1786, has been largely consulted. While
the ample notes appended to the “Life of Ambrose
Bonwicke,” as edited by Prof. John E. B. Mayor,
M.A., 1870, have been made available. I have
followed as best suited to the circumstances, a strictly
chronological arrangement.</p>

<p>As questions continually arise in the progress of
our record regarding the rights of the town of
Cambridge over the fair, it will be well here briefly
to indicate how these may have arisen. In the inquisition
of the Commissioners already referred to,
it is recorded that “the keepers of this Hospital
hold twenty four acres and a half of land in Cambridge
field, for the support of the Lepers therein
dwelling according to ancient right and custom.”
From other sources it appears that the Hospital
was at the disposal of the burgesses of Cambridge
previous to 1245; but that about this time Hugh
de Northwold, the then Bishop of Ely “unjustly
got the patronage of it.” The burgesses still
claimed that the advowson of the Hospital “belonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
by right to them.” The fact probably
being that the hospital was established by the town,
before it was converted into a religious foundation;
that upon such conversion the Church claimed sole
jurisdiction; but as the original grant of land was
not relinquished the townsmen still asserted their interest;
and it will be seen, in the end—and after
centuries of conflict—obtained it. See 1544.</p>

<p>There is a further element of conflict, of a far
more pertinacious character than the preceding,
running almost entirely through our six centuries of
record—and this is with the University, as distinguished
from the Town, of Cambridge. It was the
custom to grant to University towns very large
powers regarding the food supplies, <i>i.e.</i> the control
of the markets; as also, and necessarily, the control
of the morals, and therefore the amusements, of the
scholars. Such a fair as that of Sturbridge affected
alike the food supplies, and the moral discipline of
the students; and hence the whole machinery of
the University was put in force to secure and maintain
control. It is in this view that many of the
details of the University Proclamation of the Fair
(see 1548) can alone be explained. On the other
hand the Town authorities always had in view their
rights over the Lepers Hospital; and hence their
reversion in the tolls of the fair. Other points
will make themselves apparent; but these are the
broad views from which many of the following
incidents have to be regarded.</p>

<p><i>Name of the Fair.</i>—The first point of interest is
the name of the Fair. It is occasionally spelled in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
such a manner as to be entirely misleading as to its
locality; and hence many have come to regard it
as being in the western, instead of the eastern part
of the kingdom. The spelling indeed has varied
much at different periods. The original designation
was Steresbrigg, so called from the little river of
<i>Stere</i>, or <i>Sture</i> flowing into the <i>Cam</i>, near Cambridge.
There have been several fanciful origins
assigned by those who were too indolent to investigate
proper sources: such as (by Bloomfield)
that it was derived from the toll paid for all young
cattle, or <i>steers</i> passing over the bridge! I have

<p class="dropcap">The Commissioners of Edward I. (already
referred to) returned upon inquest
that King John had granted
this Fair for the benefit of the Hospital
for Lepers which stood there. “To the said
Hospital belongs a certain Fair, held at the Feast of
the raising and exaltation of the Cross, which continues
to this eve of Holy Cross, within the meadow
belonging to the said Hospital, which Fair our
sovereign Lord King John, the predecessor of our
present Lord the King, granted to the said Hospital,
for the use and subsistence of the Lepers dwelling
therein.”</p>

<p>1351. A writ was on 3rd Oct. directed to the
Sheriff of Cambridgeshire requiring him to convey
to the Keeper of the King’s Wardrobe in the
Tower of London, thirty-seven strait cloths, and
one cloth of colour, lately seized in the Fair of
Steresbrigge to the King’s use, by his deputy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Alnager, as not being of the assize and which were
then in the custody of the Mayor of Cambridge.</p>

<p>1376. This year the Corporation of Cambridge
made an Ordinance, prohibiting any burgess to take
Sturbridge Chapel to farm, except to the use of the
mayor and bailiffs, or to keep market there, under
the penalty of 10 marks, or to make any booth
there, or let any place for the building of a booth,
under the penalty of 10s.; and any burgesses convicted
of a breach of this Ordinance before the
twenty-four [members of the Common Council] was
to be deprived of his freedom at their discretion.</p>

<p>1382. The King being informed that many false
weights and measures had been theretofore used in
Steresbrigge Fair, to the deception of his subjects
resorting thereto, issued a Writ on 3rd Sept. requiring
the Chancellor of the University to be
vigilant in exercising in that fair the powers conferred
on him by the late Charter [1381] respecting
weights and measures.</p>

<p>Two years later a dispute arose between the Corporation
and the University regarding the exercise
of this right. The King confirmed the privilege of
the University.</p>

<p>1395. Richard II. made order that the sheriff
was to apprehend all persons who broke the peace
in Bernwell Fair, whether scholars or townsmen.</p>

<p>1397. On Hoch Tuesday the commonalty of
Cambridge made Ordinances to the following
effect: ...</p>

<p>ii. That all burgesses having any booths at the
Fair of Sterebrigge, and who should let them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
farm to any outcomers or foreigners for certain sum
agreed upon between them, should pay to the
mayor and bailiffs the third part of the sum for
which the same should be so let.</p>

<p>iii. That no freeman should occupy two booths
of one art.</p>

<p>1403. The Corporate Ordinances made by Cambridge
this year contain (<i>inter alia</i>) the following:</p>

<p><i>Item</i> ... Every man burgess of the town of Cambridge,
may freely have one booth in the fair of
Stirbridge, without rendering any thing therefore to
the mayor and bailiffs for the time being, whether
he occupy it or let it to farm. And that no burgess
have in the fair aforesaid more than one booth, unless
he render therefore to the mayor and bailiffs for
the time being, toll and custom as others do who are
not burgesses.</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> It is ordained on the same day, that if any
bailiff or other burgess of the town aforesaid, in
future, lease or lend to any Citizens of London, the
place for the booth called the Tolbooth, in the fair
aforesaid, that the bailiffs pay to the commonalty of
the Town of Cambridge £10, and the burgesses
100s. for every default, namely <i>tociens quociens</i>, to
lose their freedom.</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> The same day it is ordained that no burgess
of the town aforesaid prosecute against any one by
writ or plaint, before the Chancellor nor elsewhere,
for any contract which can be determined before the
mayor and bailiffs [in the Piepowder Court?] nor
summon a defendant to the Chancellor, &amp;c., under
the pain of every one &amp;c. 40<i>s.</i> to be paid to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
commonalty of the town aforesaid, and the loss of
his freedom (see 1427-8).</p>

<p><i>Item.</i> The same day it is ordained, that no serjeant
of the town aforesaid for the future shall be
attorney or of counsel, <i>with any foreigner, against
any burgess of the same town</i>, in the Court of the
Town aforesaid, under the pain of 40<i>d.</i>, to be paid
to the commonalty of the town aforesaid, <i>tociens
quociens</i>. See 1575.</p>

<p>1405. The Corporation of Cambridge enacted
the following Ordinances:</p>

<p>Be it remembered, that on the day of election of
mayor and bailiffs for the town of Cambridge in the
6th year of the reign of Henry IV., it is ordained
that every burgess within the town aforesaid having
a booth or booths in the fair of Sterbrige, may well
and lawfully give, sell and surrender the said booth
to the use of any other burgess of the same town,
before the Mayor and one of the Aldermen of the
same town, in the Court there holden on every
Tuesday in the year, and on every Monday in the
Court of the Liberty: Provided always that the
said booth or booths be surrendered freely, quietly
and wholly, without condition, annexed or expressed,
for him and his, according to the custom of
the borough. And this under the pain or forfeiture
of the same booths to the burgesses of the
town aforesaid.</p>

<p>1411. On 15 Nov. John Arondell, custos of
the free chapel of St. Mary Magdalene, otherwise
called Sturbridge chapel near Barnwell, exhibited
his bill in the Exchequer against John Essex,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
sadler, John Warwyk, skinner, John Chaucer and
William Bush, late bailiffs, then present in Court on
their account. In this bill plaintiff averred that he
and his predecessors, had immemorially had stallage
of all persons merchandising upon the Chapel-yard,
parcel of his chapel, where part of the fair of
Sturbridge was accustomed to be held, and where
merchants were accustomed to erect their shops
during the fair-time. That one Thomas Spryggy
merchant and Clothier, and other merchants to the
number of 20, would have made their shops there
at the fair holden at Sturbridge on Monday the
feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross then preceding,
and would have paid the stallage 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> each
but that the late bailiffs unjustly and by colour of
their office would not permit the merchants to build
their shops in the Chapel-yard by which he lost his
stallage amounting to 10 marks, to the disherison of
the chapel, and to his damage of £10. The defendants
by their plea, after protesting that the chapel
was founded within the time of memory and that
the bailiffs of Cambridge were seized of stallage of
merchandize brought to the fair, denied that the
custos or his predecessors were seized of such stallage.
On this plea issue was joined, and a verdict
returned in favor of the custos whose damages were
assessed at 5 marks with £10 costs. The proceedings
in this cause were exemplified by letters under
the Exchequer seal, tested by John Cokayn Chief
Baron, on the 4th March 1412-13.</p>

<p>1419. At this time there was a suit pending before
the King’s Council between the Chancellor and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Scholars of the University, and the mayor, aldermen
and citizens of London, each of whom claimed
the Custody of Assize and assay of Bread, wine and
beer, and the supervision of the measures and
weights of the citizens of London coming to Sturbridge
fair. On the 14th July the King (Henry V.)
directed letters patent to sir Wm. Asenhull, knt.
sheriff of the County, commanding him to exercise
the beforementioned custody and supervision over
the citizens of London in the fair of Sturbridge,
till the matter was decided, and requiring the litigating
parties to assist the Sheriff.</p>

<p>From the accounts of the Priories of Maxtoke
(Warwickshire) and of Bicester (Oxon) during the
reign of Henry VI. it is seen that the monks laid in
yearly stores of various common necessaries, at this
fair—distant at least one hundred miles from either
monastery. Wharton (“Hist. of English Poetry”)
commenting on this fact says: “It may seem surprising
that their own neighbourhood, including the Cities
of Oxford and Coventry could not supply them
with commodities neither rare nor costly, which
they thus fetched at a considerable expense of carriage.”
But he remembers that it was a rubric in
some of the monastic rules <i>De Euntibus ad Nundinas</i>.</p>

<p>1423. In the parliament of Henry VI., this year,
the following petition was presented:</p>

<p>Prien the wise and worthi Communes, that for
as muchell as in the Citee of London, and in the
Suburbes ther of, diverses persones occupying the
craft of Brauderie, maken divers werkes of Brauderie
of unsuffisaunt stuff, and unduely wrought, as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>

the said Citee of London, for that tyme beyng may,
by auctorite of this present parlement, have warant
by patent to make serche of all werk of Braderie
put to selle at the said faires of Steresbrugg, Ely,
Oxenford and Salesbury, and thoo werkes of Brouderie
there founden unsuffisant, to forfaite and
arreste to the use of our soverain Lord the Kyng,
as ofte tymes as such werk be founde.</p>

<p>To which answer was made:</p>

<p>Be it enacted that all works and stuff with gold
and silver broidery of Cyprus or Gold of Luke, or
with laton of Spain, and sold to the deceit of the
subjects of the King, be forfeited to the King, or to
the Lords and to others having franchises of such
forfeitures, in which franchise such works be found.
And that this enactment endure only until the next
parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>The valuable commodities sold at this fair are
here in part indicated.</p>

<p>Same year the commonalty of Cambridge, on the
Thursday after the Nativity of the Virgin made an
Ordinance to this effect:</p>

<p>That the bailiff of the Bridge should not take toll
for carriage, nor stall-pence nor custom, from the
bridge, nor elsewhere (except in the fair) for merchandise
coming to the fair of Sterbrigg, from the
vigil of the nativity of the blessed Mary until the
fair was ended.</p>

<p>1425. The accounts of Richard Parentyn prior
of Burchester, in Oxfordshire, and Richard Albon
canon and bursar of that house, for the year ending
Michaelmas, contain several items which shew the
varied and extensive trade of Sturbridge fair about
this time: For the expense of Albon in going to
and from Sterisbrugge fair for five days with three
horses to buy victuals &amp;c. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is charged. The
following articles are also stated to have been purchased
here: “Three collars, one basse [a rush
collar for cart-horses] and three headstalls 5<i>s</i> 10½<i>d</i>;”
“a bolt [long narrow piece] of red say [silk] for
making a cope 4<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>”; “Six estregbords [Eastern
boards] viz Waynscots 2<i>s</i> 3<i>d</i>”; “100 halfwax-fyche
[dried fish?] 21<i>s.</i>;” “324 lbs of Spanish iron,
with the portage of the same 18<i>s</i> 5<i>d</i>”.</p>

<p>1459. Richard Andrewe, <i>alias</i> Spycer, burgess
of Cambridge by his will dated 30 Aug. bequeathed
to the mayor and bailiffs of that town
80 marks to be kept in a chest there provided, and
portions thereof lent on loans from time to time in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
sums not exceeding 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> To the keepers of this
Chest he gave, three booths and certain booth-ground
in Sturbridge Fair, and a house in St. Andrew’s
parish abutting on Preachers’ lane, the profits
to be applied to the celebration of his anniversary
in Great St. Mary’s Church, to be distributed in
various small charities there specified. See Cooper’s
“Annals,” i., p. 210.</p>

<p>1464. By 4th Edward IV. c. 8 power is given
to the Wardens of the Company of Horners to
search for defective wares in London and twenty-four
miles round, also in the fairs of Sturbridge and Ely,
and to seize defective manufactures and bring the
same before the Mayor of London or the Mayors
or Bailiffs of the aforesaid fairs, for the time being.
In 1609 this act was revived by 7 James I. c. 14,
sec. 2. The act was repealed in 1856.</p>

<p>1487. The Corporation of London made an Ordinance
prohibiting the freemen of that City to go
to any fair out of the City with any manner of
merchandise to sell or barter. This Ordinance was
repealed by act of parliament in the preamble of
which it is recited that there “be many fairs for the
common Weal of your said liege people, as at Salisbury,
Bristol, Oxenford, Cambridge &amp;c.” If this
order of enumeration had any reference to the relative
importance of the fairs (which I suspect it had
not) it puts this fair only fourth. This act has
already been set out in detail in Chapter V.</p>

<p>This year Sir Wm. Littlebury alias Horn,
citizen and salter, and also Lord Mayor of London,
gave 500 marks towards repairing the highways between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
London and Cambridge. This was probably
in view of benefiting those attending the fairs.</p>

<p>1496. On 20th July Katherine Cooke widow of
John Cooke some time mayor, granted to the
mayor, bailiffs, treasurers, and burgesses and their
successors, to the use of the Treasury of the Town
of Cambridge, three booths situate in the Soper’s
lane, the Chepe, and the Petimercerye, in Sterbrigge
fair. To the intent that the Treasurers
should perpetually uphold yearly on the 25 Feby.,
a special dirge and mass in the parish Church of St.
Mary the Virgin next the market for the souls of
John Cooke and William Colles, and Katherine,
Joan, and Lucy their wives, and pay to the bell-man
for going about the town for the said souls 3<i>d</i>;
with other small bequests to the poor &amp;c. Cooper’s
“Annals,” i., p. 246.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The accounts of the Treasurers of
Cambridge for this year contained
the following item:</p>

<p>Paid John Fynne, Clerk to make
up the farm of the land called the Chapel ground
lying in Sturbridge Fair leasted to the Mayor,
bailiffs and burgesses, beyond the money received
for the farm of the same this year, <i>because a great
part of the same was not levied this year, by reason
that the merchants of London withdrew themselves
from the Fair</i>, 100<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This lease had been taken on 7th Aug. 1497
for a term of 99 years at a rent of £12, and five
tapers of wax for the chapel of equal weight, and
weighing in the whole 3 lbs.</p>

<p>1503. William Kentte the younger, Clerk, by
his will devised two booths in Sturbridge fair, and
the reversion of a tenement called the Crown in the
parish of St. Andrew in Cambridge, the mayor and
burgesses entered into covenants with his executors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
to observe and keep a yearly dirge in the Church
of St. Benedict, on the first Wednesday of the
kalends of May, and other specified observances of
a religious character.</p>

<p>1510. There was a suit between Kings Lynn
and Cambridge regarding Toll at this fair. How
the matter was then disposed of does not appear.
See 1541.</p>

<p>1517. Misunderstandings having arisen between
the Town of Cambridge and the Prior and Convent
of Barnwell the matter was referred to arbitration,
and the Award determined that the town
for evermore should have hold and enjoy, keep and
maintain the fair as well within the said town of
Barnwell &amp;c., as in all other lands and fields of the
said prior and convent, lying on the east between
the said monastery and town of Barnwell, and a
bridge called Sturbridge, from the feast of St. Bartholomew
unto the feast of St. Michael in Sept.,
and that they and their farmers might, without let
or molestation of the said prior and convent, build
stalls, shops, &amp;c., the mayor &amp;c. throwing down
all banks, chimneys, &amp;c. within four days after
Michaelmas, and provided that all such farmers
of any house or shop letten by the Prior and
Convent should pay but one shilling by the year
to the mayor &amp;c. for his and their house and
shop. “Hist. and Antiq. of Sturbridge Fair,”
p. 77.</p>

<p>1519. A dispute which had arisen between the
mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses of Cambridge and
the mayor, burgesses, and comburgesses of <i>Northampton</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
as to the claim of the freemen of the latter
town to <i>exemption from toll in Sturbridge Fair</i>, was
referred to the arbitrament of Sir Richard Elliot,
and Sir Lewis Pollard, Justices of the Common
Pleas, who on the 4th June awarded that the Corporation
of Northampton should pay 10<i>s.</i> yearly to
the Corporation of Cambridge in full satisfaction of
all toll and custom due from the freemen of Northampton,
for all manner of stuff, barrelled ware, and
other merchandise, brought by them to Sturbridge
fair, and all other passages and carriages through
and by the town of Cambridge, at all times of the
year, or and besides twopence for every cart laden
with their stuff going out of the fair. A deed of
Covenant founded on this award was entered into
by the two Corporations on the 10th of July. “Corp.
Cross. Book.”</p>

<p>1521. About this time there were proceedings
in the Court of the Duchy of Lancaster by the
tenants of <i>Hertford</i>, against Richard Clark mayor
of Cambridge, who was complained against for
seizing for toll in this fair.</p>

<p>A little later there was a like suit pending between
the tenants of the Duchy in Walden, and
the bailiffs of Cambridge. <i>A decree in favour of</i>
the Exemption was made in Easter term 1524.</p>

<p>1533-4. The Heads of the University claimed
the following rights in the Fair:</p>

<p>1. The Proctor’s Commissary and other officers
of the university keep a court in the fair, because it
is within the suburbs of Cambridge, and the university
are clerks of the market, and have the oversight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and correction of weights and measures, and
victuals in the fair.</p>

<p>2. They hold plea in the said court of contracts
and trespasses made within the said fair as without,
which was one of the things agreed upon in a composition
with the town, viz. that the university
should have the like privileges there as the mayor.</p>

<p>3. They hear and determine pleas personall as
well between scholars, servants, as all foreigners and
others of the kings subjects, if a scholar or scholars
servant be one party by the commissary in the fair
court by the order of the civil law by witness or
otherwise, excepting in causes relating to victuals,
wherein they determine according to the common
or statute law.</p>

<p>4. They make proclamation in the said fair before
the proclamation of the mayor of Cambridge,
by virtue of the King’s letter patent as conservators
of the peace, and as having the overseer of victuals
which is the first thing sold in the fair.</p>

<p>5. The Proctors search all manner of fish as well
salt-fish as other, pewter, brass, &amp;c., haires, girth-webb,
silks, furs, beds, and all upholstery wares,
spices and grocery, rape-seed, mustard-seed, fustians,
worsteds, sago, honey, soap, oil, tallow, wax &amp;c.
brought to be sold in the said fair, and take the
forfeitures of the same when faulty &amp;c. This
they do by virtue of royal charters.</p>

<p>6. The Proctors by virtue of the King’s writt
directed to the university, and as clerks of the
market are the proper gaugers in the fair to gauge
all manner of barrelled wares brought to be sold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
and take the usual fees allowed by the law for the
same, as also for weighing, viz. of every one that
bringeth salmon or any thing of like nature to be
sold, 12<i>d.</i> for every last gauging. For every last
of oil gauged 12<i>d.</i> Item, for every last of soap
weighing and gauging 12<i>d.</i> For every last of honey
weighing and gauging 4<i>s.</i> &amp;c. and the fines and
forfeitures for want of weight and measure.</p>

<p>7. The Taxers take of all victuallers in the fair
a greater or lesser sum according as they can agree
for breach of the assize of bread and beer which
they sell in the fair. N.B. This taken in lieu of
heavier penalties which the offending victualler incurrs,
and the taxers may lawfully inflict, for such
offence.</p>

<p>8. For every cart load of oats to be sold in the
fair they take 4<i>d.</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p>This declaration of rights and privileges was in
reply to charges made by the town against the
University—twenty-three in all, amongst which was
(15) of that of holding within the town a Civil Court
weekly whereat they held plea of all manner of
contracts and actions personal, as well between
foreigners as burgesses, and hold proceedings in
the Civil law in derogation of the King’s Crown.
All this the University replied they did by the
King’s Charter. That (16) they had excommunicated
two of the mayors of the town. To which answer
was, they did this for perjury! They had punished
a forestaller of honey from Banbury. They had
punished a burgess for selling tallow to a merchant
at Lynn (20). Admitted—“There was muche<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
talow conveyed owte of Cambridge so as the
Kyngs people myght have no candle sufficient.”
The answers to the charges had been given verbally
in St. Mary’s Church, and record taken. There
was much commotion on the occasion, but afterwards
“all dranke together at the Pompe Taverne,
and the Unyversyte payd for all.” See 1534.</p>

<p>Same year, 7th Sept. Princess Elizabeth (afterwards
the famous Queen) was born at Greenwich.
Intelligence was brought to the mayor by the
Queen’s minstrels, during the time of the fair, and
was there celebrated by bonfires and rejoicings. In
the accounts of the treasurer of the borough for that
year are these items:</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, payed to the Qwenys mynstrells that
brought letters to Mr. Mayer of the birthe of the
Pryncesse v<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>Item</i>, paid for ij loads woode for gaudes at the

<p><i>Item</i>, for iiij galonns wyne spent at the said
Gaudes ij<i>s</i> viij<i>d.</i></p>

<p>1534. There was enacted the 25 Henry VIII.
c. 4—<i>An Acte agaynst Forstlyng and regraytyng of
Fysshe</i>—which recited previous acts against forstalling
victuals and other merchandise in the markets
and fairs of the kingdom, “which former Statutes

&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>After ten years experience of its mischievous
tendency this act was repealed (1544).</p>

<p>The disputes between the University and the
town still continuing, a grace was this year passed
empowering such parties as were therein named to
answer determine and conclude all such controversies
as should be propounded by the mayor and
burgesses before the Lord Chancellor and the Duke
of Norfolk; and by another Grace, proctors were
appointed on the part of the University to answer
in all causes before the King’s Council. On the
24th July the parties on both sides met at Lambeth
Palace, “where it was decreed by the said Lordes
that Styrbridge Faire was in the Subarbes of
Cambridge, and that the Vice-chancellor or his
commysary might kepe courte cyvyll ther for plees
wheare a scolar was the one party. <i>Item</i>, that in
the same faire the university lead the oversight,
correction and punyshemente of all weightes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
mesures, of all maner of victayll, of all Regreators
and Forestallers. <i>Item</i>, It was determyned that
spyces be vytaill.” The expences of the University
this year for journies to London &amp;c., in consequence
of the disputes with the townsmen
amounted to nearly £80.</p>

<p>There was still some further controversy on the
point, in which Thomas Crumwell, secretary of
State, took part. See Cooper’s “Annals of Cambridge,”
i. 373.</p>

<p>1639. In Hilary term John Baker the King’s
Attorney General filed an information in the Court
of King’s Bench against the mayor, bailiffs, and
burgesses, charging that they for four years, and
more then last past, had used to have a mart or
fair at Barnwell and Sturbridge, on the morrow of
St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and continuing from
that time till the fourteenth day after the exaltation of
the Holy Cross, with all liberties and free customs
to the said mart or fair belonging and appertaining;
also to have and hold by their steward and other
ministers a Court of Piepowder, and by colour of the
same to attach disquiet and aggrieve the subjects of
the King resorting to the said fair, as well by their
bodies as by their goods and chattels, and take from
the King’s subjects divers fines and amerciaments,
and to apply the same to their own use; and also
to have all forfeitures and royalties whatsoever
within the precincts of the said mart or fair during
its continuance; all which liberties and franchises
they usurped upon the King and his prerogative
royal, to his great prejudice and damage and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
contempt of his crown. Process was thereupon
awarded, requiring the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses
to answer this information, and to show by
what warrant they claimed these liberties and franchises.
They suffered judgment against them by
default, and the liberties and franchises in the information
specified, were seized into the King’s
hands.</p>

<p>This proceeding was consequent upon the dissolution
of monasteries ordered in the preceding year—the
original grant of the fair having been made as
we have seen to a religious house. The Corporation
prayed for a new charter, and agreed to pay
1,000 marks for the same. The Charter was
granted, but the money, on the authority of
Cooper (“Annals,” i., 393), was not paid for many
years afterwards. The fair however was regularly
held. The Charter is a very lengthy document;
and as the grant was confirmed half a century later
by the charter of Elizabeth (1589), which I shall
have occasion to notice in some details for reasons
then appearing, I shall not dwell upon the present
one.</p>

<p>1541. By 33 Henry VIII. c. 39—<i>The Bill for
Town of Lynne towching the revoking of two Fairs</i>—it
is recited For so much that as well the burgesses
and inhabitants of the said borough of King’s Lynn,
as many and divers other persons dwelling near the
said borough have made regrated and gotten into
their hands and possession great numbers of salt fish
as ling, lob, salt salmon, shellfish and herring, “to
the gret hindraunce and loss of many of the King’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
subjects that yerely have repayred and com to <i>Styrbige
fair</i> Ely faire, &amp; other Fayres &amp; marketts in
the Countie of Cambryge &amp; Huntyngton and other
shyres for the provysion of salt fyshe, &amp; Heryng for
theire householdes, &amp; for the provision of dyverse
other shires within this Realme of Englande, whiche
regratyng is contrary to a comen welth and to
dyverse statutes in that case providede, and contrari
to the good entente and meanyng of the graunt
of the said Fayres and marte” It is enacted that
the grant of the said Fairs to King’s Lynn be and
was thereby repealed.</p>

<p>1542. Leland in his famous “Itinerary” at this
date records: “The brothers of Sturbridge possess
an antient house in that part where is the Fair
for the sale of woollens, commonly called the
Duddery.”</p>

<p>1544. On 27 Sept. Thomas Bishop of Ely, the
Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Church of the
Holy and Undivided Trinity of Ely, and Christopher
Fulneby, incumbent of the Free Chapel of St.
Mary Magdalene called Styrrebrige in the County
of Cambridge, demised to the mayor, bailiffs, burgesses,
and commonalty of the town of Cambridge,
the aforesaid free Chapel, with all glebe lands, tenements,
meadows, pastures, booths, and booth
grounds, standings, liberty of building booths, rents,
hereditaments, oblations, commodities and profits
(except the advowson, patronage, and donation of
the said free chapel) for 60 years at the rent of £9
per annum.</p>

<p>By means of this the entire temporal control of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the fair merged into the Corporation of Cambridge.</p>

<p>1546. There appears to have been some suit
pending at this time regarding the Fair, for at a
meeting of the Corporation of Cambridge Robert
Chapman and seven others were appointed to commune
and determine what they thought best to be
done for Sturbridge Fair, and how the charges of
the suit therof should be borne, and all other things
concerning the same. <i>Vide</i> “Corporation Common
Day Book.”</p>

<p>1547. At the Common Day held on Friday
after the Assumption it was ordered that the Bailiffs
should enter their wards at this Fair on the 6th
Sept. yearly, at 5 o’clock in the morning, and should
pay as follows: for the Bridge ward £18, for the
Market ward £12, and for the High ward £13.</p>

<p>The proctors of the University upon fresh complaints
made going their rounds one night “had
taken certain evil persons in houses of sin,” and had
brought them to the Tollboth, in order to commit
them there. But having sent to the mayor for the
keys, he absolutely refused to part with them. So
they were fain to carry their prisoners to the castle,
where they left them in custody. But the mayor’s
son, after an hour or two let them all out, “to return
if they pleased to their former lewdness; to the
breach of the law; and the affront of the magistrate.”
This led to further disagreements.</p>

<p>By an Order of the Privy Council dated 3rd Oct.
this year the mayor and undersheriff of the County
were required not only to acknowledge before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Vice-chancellor, heads of colleges and proctors,
that they had interfered with the privileges of the
University in this fair, but also “that the mayor in
common hall shall openly, among his bretheren,
acknowledge his wilfull proceeding.” The breach
consisted of John Fletcher, the mayor, having refused
to receive into the tolbooth [prison] certain
persons of “naughty and corrupt behaviour,” who
were prisoners taken by the proctors of the University,
in the last Sturbridge Fair; wherefore he was
called before the Lords and others of the Council,
and his fault therein “so plainly and justly opened”
that he could not deny it, but did “sincerly and
willingly confess the said fault.” Dyer’s “Privileges
of Cambridge,” i. p. 111.</p>

<p>About this time Nicholas Elton, burgess of Cambridge
by his will devised a booth in Sturbridge
fair to the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses, after the
death of his wife—It is supposed for charitable
purposes.</p>

<p>There had been some suggestion that the University
should sell their privileges in the Fair to the
Corporation—see 1858.</p>

<p>1548. The following is the <i>Proclamation</i> used by
the University of Cambridge about this date in
“Crying the Fair”:</p>

<p>How long this form of Proclamation remained in
force does not appear, but probably for several centuries
later. See 1855. It is seen that regulations
against adulteration and other wrongdoings of
traders, are not so modern as is sometimes supposed.</p>

<p>About this period, and probably earlier, a piece
of stuff for a gown was bought for every fellow of
St. John’s College at this fair. See “Early Stat. of
St. John’s Col. Cambr.” 1859.</p>

<p class="dropcap">For the better preservation of peace
during the fair the Lieutenants and
Commissioners of the University ordered
a “night watch” to be kept
by the scholars and townsmen. The colleges
were to supply the watchmen to the number of
twenty in the aggregate “to be thir in redynes,

every college in whom such defawt shal be, to paye

<p><i>Pewterers Company of London.</i>—On the 10th
Sept. in this fair the Wardens of the Pewterers
Company of London seized certain salt-sellers, pots
and covers of pewter, which were of insufficient
metal, and which they therefore alleged to be forfeited.
The searchers of the University and Town,
however, claimed exclusive jurisdiction of the Fair,
and took the pewter from the Wardens, who exhibited
an information in the Exchequer against
one of the Esquire Bedels and one of the Searchers;
but on the 21st Nov. the Privy Council sent the
following letter to the Wardens:</p>

<p>There is a letter of the King’s (Edward VI.)
extant which shows precisely why the Council took
this course:</p>

<p><i>New Charter.</i>—1553. On the Feast of St. Mark
the Evangelist, it was agreed by the Mayor, Alderman
and Twenty-four, that the Town for their
possessions and the other possessioners [owners of
stalls and booths] in Sturbridge fair, should pay the
King (Edward VI.) 1000 marks for the fine for
Sturbridge Fair; that the body of the town should
pay one half of all charges of obtaining the new
charter, and the town for their possessions and the
other possessioners to pay the other half. It was
also agreed that the Recorder and others should
have authority under the Common seal to sue to
the King’s majesty and his honourable Council for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
a new Charter for the fair; and further that Mr.
Robert Chapman and Mr. John Rust should pay
no money towards the charges of the charter, in
consideration of their pains in obtaining thereof,
and £90 1<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> was paid then towards the first
instalment of 200 marks for the King’s fine.</p>

<p>The Charter was not however obtained in this
reign, though the 200 marks were actually paid.
“Annals,” ii. p. 70. See 1555, 1561, 1574, 1576,
1577, 1584, 1589—when new Charter was obtained
by the town.</p>

<p>1555. 30 Jany. The Mayor, Aldermen,
Twenty-four and Bailiffs gave authority to Mr.
Robt. Chapman and Mr. John Rust to go to
London to make suit to the Council touching the
supplication made to them for the payment of the
800 marks; and for the setting forth and making
the patent for the confirmation of Sturbridge fair.</p>

<p>1556. The question of Lynn Fair—apparently
as to its revival—came on again this year, and on
2nd Aug. the Corporation ordered that the Mayor,
Mr. Chapman, and Mr. Rust should frame an
answer to a letter from the Bishop of Ely concerning
Lynn Fair, and make objections in shewing
why the same ought not to be had; and that the
Town Clerk should carry the answer to his Lordship.</p>

<p>1557. On 23 June the King and Queen (Philip
and Mary) by letters patent, granted to the Mayor,
bailiffs and burgesses, a certain annual rent of
£8 15<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> issuing out of shops and booths in
Sturbridge, which had been granted for the maintenance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
of <i>obiits</i> and anniversaries (see 1459, 1496,
1503, 1547), and alms to the poor of the town.
The letters patent state, that this Rent had been
seized into the hands of the Crown, under the
statute of Chantries (1547) and that £6 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
part thereof had been paid to the mayor, bailiffs
and burgesses for distribution amongst the poor.
This is expressed to be made from the King and
Queen, that the rites and ceremonies of the Catholic
Church should be maintained, and the wills of the
donors performed! And also because the shops
and booths in Sturbridge Fair, <i>being of customary
tenure, were not within the statute of Chantries</i>.</p>

<p>The same King and Queen granted the following
tolls payable for the merchandise brought to
the fair. This is important as showing the nature
of the goods brought at this period:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Custom and Toll due in the time of Sturbridge Fair

<p>1558. The University of Cambridge being in
want of money the question was again raised (see
1547) of selling to the Corporation of Cambridge
all privileges in this fair. The proposal met with
strong and successful opposition from the Provost of
King’s College (<i>vide</i> Fuller’s “Hist. of Univ. of
Camb.”). In the “History and Antiquities of
Barnwell Abbey,” 1786 (p. 78, part ii.) there is
the following: “Robert Brassil ... who being
Vice chancellor, in 1558, was much commended for
his wisdome in withstanding the heads &amp; masters
of Colleges in this universitie; when, as they had
all except him, consented &amp; concluded to sell all their
wrightes and jurisdictions in Sturbridge Faire to the
mayor, bayliffes &amp; burgesses of the towne of Cambridge.”</p>

<p><i>Drapers, Merchant Taylors, and Clothworkers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
London.</i>—On 3rd Sept. 1557, a letter was addressed
to the Vice-chancellor and Proctors of the University
by Nicholas Hethe Archbishop of York, Lord
High Chancellor of England, and Thomas Thirleby,
Bishop of Ely, stating that complaint had been
made unto them by the Drapers, Merchant Tailors,
and Clothworkers of the City of London, that they
repairing theretofore with their cloths to Sturbridge
fair, had been troubled in the sale thereof, through
unlawful searches pretended by divers light persons
more for their own private gain and the vexation
of the merchants than for any good intent to have
the Statutes duly executed. Their Lordships therefore
required, that in future no such unlawful searches
should be made by any such light persons, and that
merchants should not be otherwise disquieted or
ordered than was ordained and provided by the
Statutes of the realm. “Annals of Camb.” ii.
p. 135.</p>

<p>1559. There were again disputes between the
University and Town of Cambridge respecting the
watch at time of the fair. The following memorandum
drawn up by the mayor embodies the
views of Lord North and the Lord Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas thereon:</p>

<p>After our verye harty commendacions, Where we
of late with the advise and consent of the rest of
the Justices of peace of this Shire take order for the
better &amp; more quyet governement of this shire,
That duringe this Stirbridge fayre tyme the watches
for the Universitie &amp; Towne of Cambridge sholde
lovinglie joyne togither &amp; be dubled, whereof our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
verye frende Mr Baron Frevyll dyd take upon him
to advertyse you of the same, by occasion wherof
we dyd forbear to wryte unto you therein. We
now ar enformed that ye ar not as yet fully agreed
to joyne togither in the execucion of the same for
certaine respects that ye have to the preservation of
your liberties, Wherefore we do feare great inconveniens
and perill may growe, onles ye do spedelye
conforme yourselves thereunto. These are therefore
to advertyse you &amp; requyre you for the more
quietnes of this cuntrye &amp; Towne, and for the
Queenes Majesties better servyse that ye forthewith
conjoin yourselves togithers accordinglie, notwithstandinge
any persuasion to either of you to the
contrarye.</p>

<p>And furthermore understandinge that there ar
allredie a nombre of Sturdye Vacabonds &amp; masterles
men come unto Cambridg for some yll purpose as
it is supposed; We therefore do likewyse desyer &amp;
requyre you in hir majesties behalfe, that ye do take
a great respect unto the apprehendinge of them,
and to the safe keepinge of them untill the faire be
past. We meane such as come not to the intent to
labor, or otherwise lawfullie to get their livinge
prayenge you that if upon eny examinacion of anye
of them ye shall fynde eny matter worthye to be
further examined &amp; tryed out, to advertyse us immediatelie
therof so that we maye yᵉ better ayed
&amp; assist you for your better service &amp; procedinge
in the same, nothinge doubtinge but yᵉ will
lovinglye &amp; effectually consider the premisses in
suche wyse as both you and me maye avoide displeasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
and blame. And thus we byd you hartelye
farewell. From Carleton this Mondaye, the iiij of
Septembre, Aᵒ 1559.</p>

<p>1561. The Corporation appear to have renewed
their application for a grant of the fair. It was
ordered that the expense of the inquisition for the
new charter should be borne by the town.</p>

<p>1562. There was a great flood, so that the portion
of Sturbridge called the “Waterfair” could
not be occupied by the booths accustomably built
there. Whereupon the Corporation directed Robert
Chapman and others to assign another place for such
booths for this year’s fair only.</p>

<p>1567. This year George Aylston, merchant, on
behalf of the Corporation of <i>Sudbury</i> instituted
proceedings in the Duchy Court of Lancaster against
Christopher Fletcher alderman of Cambridge, for
taking his goods at this fair. Fletcher alleged that
he took the goods as a distress damage feasant, and
it seems had a decree in his favour.</p>

<p>1568. <i>Citizens of London.</i>—On 4th Nov. the
Corporation of Cambridge deputed Roger Lord
North the mayor, Francis Hinde Esq., and the
Counsel-at-law of the town to deliberate in what
way it could be contrived that the citizens of London
might return to Sturbridge fair, as of old they
were accustomed. “Annals,” ii. p. 235.</p>

<p>1571. As early as 1545 there had been passed
by the Corporation of Cambridge “an Ordinance
for the setting of Willows.” This ordinance “for
planting willows on the commons, drains, moors,
marshes and fens of the town” was renewed this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
year. Every alderman might set six score of poles
and every burgess four score up the banks of any
surface, drains, ditches, &amp;c. They to lop and top
for their own use and advantage, cleansing from
time to time the drains &amp;c. on which the same were
planted. The said willows to be held on the same
terms as the booths at Sturbridge fair were held by
the burgesses, &amp;c. See 1575.</p>

<p>1574. On the 21st Nov. Dr. Perne, Vice-chancellor,
wrote to Lord Burleigh on the subject of
the Plague visitation in Cambridge, and in the postscript
to the letter made the suggestion of a new
charter being granted to the University as follows:</p>

<p>I am enformed that there is sute made to yᵉ
Queen’s majestie by some of her highnesse privie
chamber for Sturbridg faire, for that it hath stand
seased unto her highnes hand sithence yᵉ tyme of
the raign of her highnes father, the wʰ if it might
please her highnes to bestowe to the University,
there might be such a worthie and perpetual monement
made by the rent thereof, as her majestie did
most gratiously promise at her last beinge at Cambridg
in her highnes Oration made there, &amp; the
Townesmen that be nowe occupiers thereof, yeldinge
a reasonable rent to yᵉ university for their
severall boothes. Thus I am bold to put your
honor in mynd of this, referringe the whole matter
to your honors best consideracion to do herein as
yow shall thinke good.</p>

<p>1575. At a Common Day held in the Round
Church (probably on account of the Plague being
near the Guildhall) on the 25th March the Corporation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
made a Declaration as to the tenure of booths at
Sturbridge fair of which the following are the principal
portions:</p>

<p>Forasmuch as some question hath bene made of
the maner of tenure of booths in Sturbridge Fayer,
some houlding one opinion, &amp; some another, everie
man speakinge his fantasie therein, affirminge his
owne opinion to be the true custome, and that it
ought to stande for truethe; for that it hath not
bene generally knowne to all men whether any
Custome hath remained written in any records of
this towne concerninge the same fayre, yea or no:</p>

<p>Commandment therefore had been given to the
Town Clerk to search the records of the town.
This had been done and “it is founde in the oulde
and ancient record called the Cross Booke of the
sayde Towne, that remaineth there written.” This
I have already given, under date 1403. The same
was reaffirmed; and it was now ordered that every
burgess claiming a booth must have his title thereto
entered in a book to be kept by the Corporation for
that purpose; and thereafter he might alienate the
same to any other free burgess by due entry in the
said book in manner and form provided.</p>

<p>1576. 8th Dec. The Corporation sealed a power
of attorney (dated 30th Nov.) authorizing the
Recorder and others named to act in all matters
before the Queen and her Council, and in all causes
and businesses touching the town, particularly the
redemption and confirmation of Sturbridge Fair.
To this end the Corporation empowered the Mayor
and others to rate the possessioners of booths in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
fair towards the payment of 1000 marks for the
fine for the fair.</p>

<p>On 13th of same month Lord Burleigh the Chancellor,
and the Earl of Leicester High steward of
the University wrote to Dr. Goad the Vice-chancellor,
desiring that there might be a conference
between the heads of the University and Town relative
to the contemplated grant of the fair. Lord
Burleigh it seems had obtained from the Queen a
declaration that no petition of the townsmen respecting
their fair should be received to the prejudice
of the University.</p>

<p>A meeting took place early in the following year
but no friendly understanding could be arrived at.</p>

<p>1577. The matter of renewing the charter of
the fair was again before the Queen. On a petition
being presented on behalf of the Corporation the
Royal reply was “that she would not take away
any privileges that she had granted the University,
but would rather add to them”; and for this declaration
the University returned her a letter of
thanks. “Annals,” ii. 358.</p>

<p>At the fair this year the Mayor, Recorder, and
Aldermen of the Corporation ordered a haberdashery
booth to be pulled down. Reason not
stated. The Corporation sustained the order.</p>

<p>The following articles were purchased at the fair
for the household of Lord North. The record of
prices is particularly important:</p>

<p>A C. Salt Fish, Lixˢ; whight salt, iij stone, 1 qt.
iij lb. xiijˢ; bay salt, iij qt. Lvjˢ; 2 kettles, xiijˢ vjᵈ; ix

14 lb. of matches, iijˢ ixᵈ; dogg cowples xxᵈ; 10 lb.

<p>1578. The “provision bought at Sturbridge
Fayer” for the household of Lord North this year,
comprised: Codds bought ccccli. vijˡⁱ xvˢ; Soape
bought 2 firkins xxviijˢ; Salte bought iijˡⁱ xiiiˢ iiijᵈ;
Lynen clothe pd. for xxxvijˢ.</p>

<p>1584. An unsuccessful attempt at accommodation
between the University and the Town was made in
1580. The former sought for additional privileges
which the latter would not grant. This year a more
successful attempt was made, and except upon three
points, the parties had agreed to “both books” (<i>i.e.</i>
draft charters). The points were these:</p>

<p>1. As to an interpretation of “common ministers.”</p>

<p>2. The demand of the University is unreasonable
to have all graduates in England go toll free.
“That the towne assentith as they ment it at the first,
That all graduates for lernings sake abydyng in the
Universety or Towne shall goe toll free.”</p>

<p>3. The town had already assented that the University
should have more retained servants than they
had before. “But squyre beadalles should eche of
them have one reteyned servaunt priviledged (being
themselves but servauntes), The Towne thinkith
it inconvenient, and neither did, nor yet doth assent
therunto: for all other matters concerning both
bookes, both parties are agreed. So as that be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
perfourmed which hath bene concluded in former
conferences.”</p>

<p>1586. The negociations between the University
and the Town were renewed this year. The following
document shows the position of the negociation,
as also that the town were to have the new charter;
it also shows the extreme jealousy with which each
body viewed the acts and proceedings of the other—it
was a genteel manifestation of “Town and
Gown” divergencies, which have become historical:</p>

<p><i>Sturbridge.</i> The towne hath obtained of her
majestie a graunt of Sturbridge feyre, to the booke
of that graunt the universitie addith a proviso to
this effect viz that neither that graunt nor anything
therein conteyned should any ways prejudice the
universitie of Cambridge, or any member thereof,
in such thinges as the universitie enjoyed before the
sayd graunt! The towne sayth that that proviso is
to large, forasmuch as it may be extended to all
thinges which the universitie befor enjoyed, as well
within the feyr as els whear, we confesse it is so;
and we say it is great reason it should be so, least
under the colour and pretense of Sturbridge feyre,
they might carry away some other of our commodities
wʰ her highness never meant. So shortly we
say thus muche; seing our proviso is nothing but a
restreint of their book: How farre so ever their
book reachith, so farre reachith our proviso and no
further.</p>

<p>This is the brief our present difference, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>This year was simplified the form of procession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
made in proceeding to read the Proclamation of the
University.</p>

<p><i>New Charters.</i>—1589. The proceedings already
recorded (with some others in 1587 not specifically
referred to) ended in the grant of new charters of
the fair to the Town and also to the University of
Cambridge respectively. The charter to the town
passed the Great Seal at Drayton on 15th Aug.;
that to the University on 30th Aug.</p>

<p>The charter to the <i>Town</i> commences with a recital
that previously to the 30 Henry VIII. the
mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses had from time immemorial
had and used a fair called Sturbridge Fair
held at Barnwell and Sturbridge, in the county of
Cambridge and within the liberty of the town, beginning
on the Feast of St. Bartholomew the
Apostle, and continuing from thence till the fourteenth
day next after the Feast of the Exaltation of
the Holy Cross; which fair, from the advantages
of the place, its contiguity to the University, and
the fitness of the season, <i>far surpassed the greatest and
most celebrated fairs of all England; whence great
benefits had resulted to the merchants of the whole
kingdom, who resorted thereto, and there quickly sold
their wares and merchandises to purchasers coming from
all parts of the Realm</i> to buy and provide salt-fish,
butter, cheese, honey, salt, flax, hemp, pitch, tar,
and all other wares and merchandises, and from the
profits of which fair the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses
levied the greatest part of their fee-farm, and
supported and maintained the town in its ways,
streets, ditches [sewers] and other burthens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>Of the Quo Warrant in the 30th Henry VIII. and
the subsequent proceedings thereon. The Queen
had been requested to grant a charter and had assented
“moved thereto by royal pity, by a sense of
the utility of the fair to the town and to the merchants
of the kingdom, and that the town should be
lightened in its burthens, and increased and honoured
under her prosperous and peaceful government.”
The Queen therefore delivered out of her hands
and conferred to the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses
and their successors, the fair in question, with all
profits, commodities, courts, profits of courts, authorities
and jurisdictions, booths and power of building
booths in the accustomed places in the fair.</p>

<p>All rights had or enjoyed by the <i>University</i>, or
its officers under any gift, grant, or confirmation
from the crown, or any act of parliament, or “used
for the greater part of 20 years then last past” were
reserved to it.</p>

<p>Power given to Corporation to make rules and
statutes for the peaceful and quiet government of
the fair; and with respect to the building and removing
of booths, and the disposition and assurance
thereof by will, gift, surrender or otherwise; and
also for placing the several arts, occupations, mysteries,
merchants, workmen, and others holding
booths in the fair in the places assigned and accustomed
to the same arts &amp;c. and especially in that
part of the fair called Cheapside. Such Ordinances
&amp;c. not to prejudice the right, title, or interest of
burgesses holding or possessing booths according to
the customs and ordinances of the town, or to derogate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
from the privileges of the Chancellor, masters,
and scholars used during the greater part of twenty
years then last past. New rules might be altered
and revoked as circumstances should require.</p>

<p>The sellers of mercery or grocery ware were forbidden
to be stationed or to occupy any booth in
the fair for selling such wares except in Cheapside.
Woollen cloths were to be exposed for sale only in the
“Duddery.” Goldsmiths were not to be stationed,
or expose their goods to sale any where except in
Soper Lane, otherwise Goldsmith’s Row; and pewterers
and braziers were in like manner to be confined
to Pewtry Row and Brazier Row.</p>

<p>The burgesses who held any booth for life or
years, or who should afterwards acquire any, were
to hold the same as theretofore.</p>

<p>The charter to the <i>University</i>, expressed to have
been granted by the authority of parliament, contains
provisions relating to the town as well as to
the fair. I shall confine my abstract to the latter.
It was granted out of love of the University, to confirm
and establish the privileges, liberties, immunities,
pre-eminences, authorities, powers, jurisdictions, profits
and commodities of that body in Sturbridge Fair,
as granted by the charter she had given in the 3rd
year of her reign. She granted to the Chancellor
masters and scholars and their successors solely and
wholly for ever the office of “Clerk of the Market,”
and the assay of bread, wine, and ale or beer, and
the keeping and governance of the same and the
correction and punishment of offenders, with the
fines, forfeitures and amerciaments thence arising in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
the fair and the precincts of the same. Also the
supervision of measures and weights, and the jurisdiction
to inquire of all forestallings, regratings, and
ingrossing of victuals and other things and wares
within the fair or its bounds and precincts, and to
banish, chastise, and correct according to the laws of
the realm and the customs of the University. Also
right of search in the fair for harlots and vagabonds.</p>

<p>The proclamation of the fair was to be made
by the University and Town in alternate years. All
goods carried to or by the fair, or to the town, or
in the river to the use of the Chancellors, masters,
scholars, or colleges, or to or for any of the graduates
residing within the town or University, or within
five miles thereof to be <i>free of toll</i>.</p>

<p>The University to have exclusive jurisdiction in
suits wherein scholars, scholars servants “or common
minister of the University” were one of the
parties. Also to hear and determine plaints concerning
victuals or contract for victuals arising in
the fair, except in cases between a burgess and a
foreigner not privileged of the University, which
should be heard before the Mayor, &amp;c. The court
of the Chancellor &amp;c. within the fair to be a court
of record with all powers according to the statutes
of the realm, or the laws and customs of the University.
The last named court to be held within
the fair or its precincts, and the Queen granted a
sufficient piece of ground for the purpose. But if
by flood or other chance the accustomed place
should be unfit another place was to be provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>The University to have exclusive authority to
inspect, search, try, assay and gauge all victuals in
the fair. The daily inspection and search of all
other wares (except leather and sackcloth) to be
made by four suitable men, appointed by the Chancellor
and Mayor respectively. And the court for
adjudication upon the same to be held by the Chancellor
and Mayor in alternate years, each aiding the
other in the performance of the duties. The remaining
numerous provisions are not necessary to
be cited in view of our present purposes.</p>

<p>It was the belief of the townspeople that this
charter to the University had been obtained by
reason of a betrayal of the rights of the town by the
then Mayor. And the following was recorded at the
foot of a transcript of this charter. “One Gawnt
was Mayor of Cambridge, who att London assented
to these new jurisdictions of the Universitie, and
therein betrayed the towne, who shortlie after was
putt [out!] of his Aldermanshipp &amp; lived the remaynder
of his life in great want and miserie, and
hatefull to all the townsmen.”</p>

<p>1591. On 30th Aug. the Corporation made
orders that all the provisoes, conditions and articles
contained in the new charter touching booths in
Sturbridge Fair, should be inviolably kept and observed
in all points, according to the tenor, true
intent and meaning of such charter: that it should
not be lawful to any tenant or owner of any booth
to admit or suffer any merchants or artificers of
sundry wares to stand and sell wares in one booth:
and that it should not be lawful to any merchants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
or others bringing wares to Sturbridge Fair to sell
any wares, except salt, out of any vessels upon the
water there, until the fish booths were let to farm.</p>

<p>On 15th Sept. Richard Parish of Chesterton “a
very violent and turbulent person, attacked and
wounded with a dagger some scholars who were with
him in the ferry-boat between Chesterton and Sturbridge
Fair. He was arrested by a master of arts
of Trinity College and others, but was rescoued from
them by the prentises in the faire.” A new manifestation
of the “town and gown” troubles.</p>

<p>1592. On 28th Aug. the Corporation of Cambridge
made orders that none but freemen should,
in time of Sturbridge Fair, sell and deliver fish in
any hut or vessel on the water, until the fish booths
in the water-fair were let, and then to make composition
with the bailiff of the ward. And that all
except freemen, who brought pitch and tar to the
fair to be sold, should pay 2<i>s.</i> per last for grinding
to the bailiff of the ward; and that if any suit or
controversy at law should arise about executing the
premises, the charges should be borne by a levy to
be assessed upon the burgesses.</p>

<p>1595. Memorandum, that this daye and yeare
by a common consente, it is agreed, that the order
made ... Feby anno Regni Hen. Octavi 13ᵒ concerninge
enjoyers of booths to dwell within the
towne; and shewinge in what time he shall sell
them yf he go out of the towne, shall stand, remaine
and be in full force and effecte; and that no
maior of the towne of Cambridge from henceforthe
shall propounde any grace, or do any acte or actes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
devise or devises whatsoever, to the breache or
violating thereof; and that the maior of this towne,
yearly to be chosen, on the daie of his election, or
on the daye that he taketh the oathe against vintinge,
shall make solemn oathe to the observation hereof
“Hist. and Antiq. of Barnwell Abbey” (p. 96,
part ii.).</p>

<p>1596. 16th Aug. The Corporation made an
order that every burgess who should thereafter buy
any booth or booth-ground in this fair should at the
time of his admission thereto, make solemn oath
before the mayor, that he had bought the same
simply to the use of himself and his heirs, and not
to the use of any foreigner or foreigners, without
fraud, collusion, or deceit.</p>

<p class="dropcap">On 16th Aug. the Corporation of Cambridge
made ordinances that no bailiff
should “by any wayes, meanes, or
culler whatsoever demise or lett to
ferme his bayliwich within this Town or Fayers,
or eny profitts belonging to the same, to eny persone
or persones whatsoever, uppon payne of disfrannchisinge.”</p>

<p>1601. New causes of dispute arose between the
University and the Town, this time about the
“King’s beam” (<i>Pondus Regis</i>) or the right of the
former to a beam for weighing articles sold at the
Fair. The Queen (Elizabeth) wrote to the parties:</p>

<p>To our loving friends the Vice-chancellor and
Proctors of the University of Cambridge and the
Mayor Bailiffs and Burgesses of the Town:</p>

<p>Whereas there were at the last Sturbridge fair
some contentions about a pair of scales used by you
of the University: We require you of the Town
in all peaceable sort, to suffer the University to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
exercise and use the same in the accustomed place
as they have usually done for the most of these ten
years last past; and what contention soever shall
seem to arise about the same scales, either for the
interest of the ground whereon they are settled, or
for the payment of any rent for the same: We
think it fit and so we require of you, that it be
peaceably reconciled hereafter in a lawful course,
without giving any occasion of disorders. And so
we heartily bid you farewell. Aug. 27, 1601.</p>

<p>1603. The kingdom was threatened with another
visitation of the plague. The new King (James I.)
issued a Proclamation, dated from Hampton Court
8 Aug., whereby it was ordained that for “desire
of preventing an universal contagion among our
people” (<i>inter alia</i>) Stourbridge Fair should not
be held nor anything appertaining to it at the time
accustomed, “nor any time till they [it] shall have
been licensed by us.”</p>

<p>1604. On 23rd July this year the King issued
the following mandate, prohibiting all idle games,
plays, or shows in or within five miles of Cambridge;
and under its authority the regulations of the Fair
were considerably modified:</p>

<p>James by the grace of God King of England
Scotland France and Ireland defender of the faith,
&amp;c.:</p>

<p><i>Given</i> under our signet at our palace of Westminster,
the three and twentieth day of July, in the
second year of our reign of England France and
Ireland and of Scotland the seven and thirtieth.</p>

<p>1606. In the records of the Skinners Company
there is an item under this date “To the wardens
for their allowance in riding to Stourbridge Fair
£3: 6: 8; and 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to me the Recter Warden
for my pains.” But very soon after this period
there are signs of a falling-off in the importance of
the fair in this particular: In 1616 it is the accountant
who receives “in allowance towards his
charges in riding to Stourbridge Fair £6.” The
wardens had ceased to attend personally.</p>

<p>1612. In the “Letters of Archbishop Williams”
(1866) is one dated from the Proctors’ booth in the
fair this year.</p>

<p>1613. In Dr. Nathan Drake’s “Shakespeare and
his Times” it is recounted that at this date the fair
had acquired so great a celebrity that Hackney
coaches attended it from London. Subsequently
not less than sixty of those coaches plied the fair
(see 1688, &amp;c.). He adds that vast quantities of
butter and cheese found there a ready market; that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
it stocked the people in the counties of Norfolk,
Suffolk, and Essex with clothes and all other necessaries;
and that the shopkeepers supplied themselves
from hence with the commodities wherein
they dealt.</p>

<p>1615. On the 22nd June the Corporation ordered
that Mr. French the mayor should have an
irrevokable power of attorney under the Town seal
to prosecute with effect all the suits already begun
against those who <i>kept any fair or market to the
prejudice of the town</i>, and to commence and prosecute
suits against all who had done or should do the
like; and it was ordered that all charges should be
paid by the treasurers on demand.</p>

<p>1620. On 17th Sept., there was held a session of
Goal Delivery in Sturbridge Fair, in the place where
the courts there were usually kept (“Annals of
Camb.” iii. p. 136). No explanation of the circumstance
is given.</p>

<p>1622. The suit concerning the right to erect
booths in the yard of Sturbridge Chapel which had
been pending for some time was this year terminated.
The Corporation obtained a grant of the
Chapel from the Queen.</p>

<p>1625. In consequence of the Plague again being
prevalent in the kingdom Charles I. by Royal Proclamation
forbids the holding of this, as also Bartholomew’s
Fair, by reason of the usual “extraordinary
resort out of all parts of the kingdom” of
persons to attend this fair, which would if held lead
to the common danger. This proclamation is given
<i>in extenso</i> in our chapter on “Legislation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>1630. The plague existing in Cambridge the
holding of this, and also Bartholomew and Southwark
Fairs, was prohibited by Royal Proclamation.</p>

<p>1633. A question arose as to Dower, or the right
to dower of the widows of booth-holders in this
fair; and the Corporation on the 14th May enacted
the following declaration:</p>

<p>The custom in such case is (and so hath ever
time out of mind been used) that the relict and
widow of her husband (who in his life was seised of
booths in Sturbridge fair) shall have her dower of
such booths only whereof her husband was seised
and died intestate. But where the husband in his
life time made sale of his booths or devised them
by his last will and testament, the wife and relict
in such case shall have no dower of any booths.</p>

<p>1636. The King (Charles I.) addressed a letter
to the Vice-chancellor of the University and the
mayor of Cambridge (dated Hampton Court,
June 14), setting forth that the town had been
often infected with the plague by means of persons
repairing to the fairs, with goods brought from infectious
places, whereby the scholars had been forced
to forsake their studies and scatter themselves for
safety unto remote parts of the kingdom: to avoid
the like mischief from the contagion then raging in
London and other places H. M. required the
Vice-chancellor and Mayor to take order that
Midsummer fair should not be kept this year, nor
the goods of Londoners or others be sold within
the town or three miles of the same. Refractory
persons were to be bound to appear before the King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
or the Privy Council to answer the contempt, or on
their refusal might be committed to prison. All
justices of the peace of the county and town were
commanded to be aiding and assisting.</p>

<p>In consequence of this letter it was feared that a
similar order might be made as to Sturbridge Fair;
and accordingly on Common Day, held 2nd Aug.
steps were taken by the townsmen in view of procuring
this fair to be held. But the result was the
following letter dated 21 Aug.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">To our trustie and wel beloved The maior &amp;
Aldemen of our Towne of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Charles R. Trustie and wel beloved we greete
you well, whereas out of our royal care of our
Universitie and Towne of Cambridge, and to prevent
the encrease and further spreading of the plague
within our Kingdome by such a publique concourse
of people as doth usually resort to Sturbridge faire
from all parts thereof, wee have thought fitt to
forbid the keepinge of the said faire for this yeare,
and have accordingly given order for signifyeing our
royall pleasure therein by a Proclamacion, which
requireing some time for the solemne publicacion
thereof; to yᵉ end ye may not in the meane while
proceede to proclaime and sett forth the precincts
of the said faire, as wee are informed that your custome
is to doe on the 24th of this presente moneth,
Wee doe by these our Letters declare our said purpose
to you of putting off the said faire for this
yeare. And in consequence thereof, Our will and
pleasure is, That you now forbeare to make any
such preparacion to the said Faire or to doe any act<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
whatsoever apperteyning thereunto, under paine of
our royal displeasure.</p>

<p>Given under our Signett at our Courte at the
Castle of Warwicke, the 21th day of August, in the
Twelfe yeare of our raigne 1636.</p>

</div>

<p>The Town Clerk, the Attorneys of the Town
Court and other of the Corporation were ordered to
attend at the fair-field to publish his majesty’s
pleasure and command. This was accordingly done
on 24th Aug., the letter being read at the usual
place of proclaiming the fair.</p>

<p>A proclamation prohibiting the fair was issued;
and although it bore date prior to the Royal letter
was only received after it. The proclamation contained
this passage:</p>

<p>... And his majesty doth hereby further charge
and command, under the like penalty, all Citizens
and Inhabitants of his City of London, that none
of them for this present year, shall bring or send any
of their Goods or merchandize to <i>Ely</i>, <i>Newmarket</i>,
or any other place near to the University of Cambridge,
at or about the usual time appointed for
Sturbridge fair, which were but to transfer that fair
to other places, with no less Danger of dispersing
the Sickness throughout the Kingdom. Given at
our Court at Warwick Castle, the 20 day of Aug.</p>

<p>1637. The fair was also again prohibited on
account of the prevalence of plague.</p>

<p>1638. Although the Plague prevailed this year
also, it seems that the fair was held. On the 24th
Aug. the Corporation imposed a rate of 1<i>s.</i> in
the £ on the booth-holders for defraying the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
charges of procuring the fair to be kept again—“being
otherwise in danger of being put by”; and
for endeavour of a like nature in the two preceding
years.</p>

<p>1644. A writer in the parliamentary interest referred
to the “Goodly and full Fair” held at Sturbridge
this year “with free trade and comforable commerce
as was formerly accustomed in our former
most peaceable times.”</p>

<p>1647. The University complained to the House
of Lords against the bailiffs of the Corporation for
contempt of the order of the House in favour of
the University in the matter of the “Stourbridge
fayer privileges.” The matter appears somewhat
obscure.</p>

<p>1649. This year an event occurred which had a
considerable though indirect bearing upon this fair.
The “Act for the Draining of the Great Level of
the Fens” was passed. This led to considerable
alterations in the navigation between Lynn and
Cambridge. The tide, which formerly flowed up
as far as Ely—bringing merchandise at easy charge
up to that point—did not, on the completion of
these works, come within twenty miles of that
place. In 1653 the University and Corporation of
Cambridge justly petitioned Parliament on the subject
(“Annals of Camb.” iii. p. 455). I believe no
redress was obtained. There were obviously some
counterbalancing advantages in lessening the frequency
of floods, and in rendering better roads
possible.</p>

<p>1650. At a Common Day, held 24th Aug., the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Corporation, taking notice that of late years there
had been controversies about a preaching minister
for Sturbridge Fair, agreed that the power of election
being in the mayor and aldermen, such preacher
should be elected yearly on the day of the election
of mayor, bailiffs, and other officers. See 1710.</p>

<p>1654. About this time the Corporation of Cambridge
erected a banqueting-room and court-house
at Sturbridge fair. It was commonly called the
Mayor’s House. At a later period (1670) Some
disputes arose regarding this building being erected
upon grounds subject to the right of commonage.</p>

<p>1655. When the office of “Lord of the Taps”
was founded does not appear, but on the 20th
Aug. this year the Corporation made the following
order:—“It is agreed that xxˢ shall be given
out of the moneys in the chest to Michael Wolfe
towards the buyinge of a Coate against Sturbridge
fayer now next ensuinge, he being Lord of the
Taps this present yeare.” The coat in question
was a crimson one, gaily decorated with taps. The
office of the Lord of the Taps was to taste the ale
in any or all the booths in the fair, and ascertain if
it were in suitable vendible condition. “Ned
Ward” speaks of this functionary (1700) as going
“arm’d all over with spiggots and fossets, like a
porcupine with his quills, or looking rather like a
fowl wrapped up in a pound of sausages.”</p>

<p>1658. In “Worthington’s Diary” there is an
entry made at the Vice-chancellor’s court at the
fair. In Brathwaite’s “Honest Ghost,” published
this year (p. 189), there occurs the following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When th’ fair is done, I to the colledg come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or else I drink with them at Trompington,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Craving their more acquaintance with my heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till our next <i>Sturbridg faire</i>; and so we part.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Local events were associated with the fair, as the
most prominent recurring incident in the district,
and dated by reference to it.</p>

<p>1660. Worthington speaks of this fair as “the
Carpenter’s harvest.”</p>

<p>1665. The fair was again prohibited this year
on account of the prevalence of the plague.</p>

<p>1666. The like by an order in Council “to prevent
the spread of the infection.”</p>

<p>1668. Pepys received so earnest an invitation
from his kinsman, Roger Pepys, that he resolved
to let his wife go to this fair. His entry, under
date 15th Sept., is:—“Up by times ... took wife
and Mercer and Deb. and W. Horner (who are all
to set out this day for Cambridge, to cosen Roger
Pepys to see Sturbridge Fayre) ... saw them gone,
there being only one man in the coach beside them.”
He probably followed some days after, or about
the 29th; but unfortunately the diary is a blank
up to 11th October. It would have been matter
of some interest to know his views of this great
gathering.</p>

<p>Edward Kemp preached a sermon at St. Mary’s
Church, Cambridge, on the Sunday before the fair,
which was published.</p>

<p>1673. In the Vice-chancellor’s “Little Black
Book” is given a copy of the following letter from
Charles II. restoring to the University the right of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
weighing hops, which had been assumed by the
Town during the Civil War troubles:—</p>

<p>Charles R. Trusty and well beloved we greet
you well. Whereas wee are informed from our
University of Cambridge that severall of their rights
and priviledges (which they have heretofore injoyed
by charter and custome) have in these late yeares of
publick distraction been intrenched upon by our
towne of Cambridge, and some of the officers thereto
belonging, particularly the right of setting up the
sole publick beame for the weighing of hops and
other things of great bulk in Sturbridge faire, which
did anciently belong to the said University and
their officers, and which as we are informed (besides
other evidences) appears by the acts of your courts
registred in the mayoralty of Mr Foxton. Now
wee being desirous to keepe a good correspondence
between our said University and towne, and that
either body should enjoy their just rights, have
thought fitt to request you to permitt our University
and their officers (till you shall shew sufficient
cause to the contrary) to enjoy without disturbance
the aforesaid right of sole weighing such hops as
shall be sould at Sturbridge faire, together with all
other their antient priviledges. And upon notice shall
be carefull, that no intrenchment bee made upon
any of those rights which you may justly claime.
Given under our signet manuell at our court of
Whitehall the thirtieth day of August in the twelfth
yeare of our reigne. (Signed) William Morrice.</p>

<p>To our trusty and well beloved the mayor and
aldermen of the towne of Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>The original was delivered to Mr John Ewen,
mayor, by me Matth. Whenn.</p>

<p>1677. The Corporation of Cambridge ordered
the common seal to be affixed to a petition to the
King for the prevention of a new fair at Maidstone,
which might be prejudicial to Sturbridge Fair.
This opposition I assume had reference to the large
trade in hops here transacted. (See hereon De
Foe’s account of this fair under date 1723.) There
is this curious entry in the Corporation Common
Day Book:—“It is agreed that Mr. Langley who
took great paines in keeping of the Patent for the
intended Faire at Maidstone shall have two gynneys
given him, to be paid by the Treasurers.”</p>

<p>1683. Dixon, in his “Canidia, or the Witches,”
published this year, says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A fire licking a Child’s hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was to be seen at <i>Sturbridge fair</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a lambent flame, all over a sweating mare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Women-dancers, Puppet-players,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At Bartholomew and Sturbridge-Fairs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>1686. Mr. Millington, book auctioneer of London,
sold in Cooks’ Row in the fair this year (8th
Sept.) the library of James Chamberlain, fellow of
St. John’s College (1700).</p>

<p>1688. On 10th September the Corporation made
an order that the prices of hackney coachmen who
drive from Cambridge to Sturbridge fair, or from
that fair to Cambridge, from sun rising to sunset,
should be 12<i>d.</i> for one, two, three, or four persons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
and after sunset 18<i>d.</i> for the like number of persons.</p>

<p>1696. Mr. Morley in his “Memoir of Bartholomew
Fair” (1859), writing of this period says,
“The great fair near Cambridge—Stourbridge Fair—was
in the days of which we are now speaking, a
place of large commerce” (p. 351).</p>

<p class="dropcap">There was published “A Step to Stirbitch-fair,
with remarks upon the University
of Cambridge,” by Edward
Ward. Like all “Ned Ward’s”
books, it is written in a coarse slangy style; and I do
not find anything throwing much light upon the
fair, except in the matter of book auctions, of which
his account is very amusing.</p>

<p>1701. The mayor and corporation having given
a company of actors leave to perform at the fair
without the sanction of the Vice-chancellor, and in
defiance of his authority, the senate, on the 4th
Sept. passed a grace enacting that the privileges of
the University should be defended and vindicated
at the public charge; and in the meantime, to prevent
a breach of discipline the authority of proctors
during the time of the fair was conferred on sixty-two
Masters of Arts, and it was decreed that whoever
disobeyed them should <i>ipso facto</i> incur the penalty
of expulsion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>It seems that the Vice-chancellor (Dr. Bentley)
committed Dogget the actor to gaol, and ordered
the booth built for the theatre to be demolished.</p>

<p>1705. The London newspapers of this year announced
“That the fair would be proclaimed on the
7th Sept. with great solemnity by the Vice-chancellor
of the University, the Mayor of the Town, accompanied
by Lord Duplin and Mr. Cadogan, the representatives
in Parliament, the Recorder, Aldermen,
&amp;c., preceded by red-coats and other officers on
horseback, with music playing before them; that it
was expected there would be greater concourse of
people and a more flourishing trade than had been
known for several years past, owing to the conduct
of a set of gentlemen who were endeavouring to
revive the reputation of a fair not many years ago
the most considerable in Europe.” This announcement,
which in great part contained nothing out of
the common, it turned out was inserted at the instance
of a Londoner who was going to see the fair
for the first time; and it had the effect of drawing
together more people than had been seen there for
ten years. The visitor in question records in the
“Gentleman’s Magazine” that he regularly took
coach every afternoon at the Market-hill (Cambridge)
with other gownsmen, drinking tea at the
Coffee-booth, “where now and then we had the
company of some very agreeable ladies of Cambridge
town and education, and a fortnight was
thus spent.”</p>

<p>1709. There was published in London: “Nundinæ
Sturbrigienses,” a poem in Latin hexameters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of some five hundred lines, by Th. Hill, Coll. Trin.
Cant. Soc. It is included in vol. ii. “Musæ Anglicanæ,”
editio quinta. Londini, ex officina J. S. R.
Tonson and J. Watts, 1741. An * indicates that
the poem in question was added to this edition,
and not found in former ones. The poem gives
a description of the fair as it existed in the reign of
Queen Anne.</p>

<p>1710. The question of the preachership of the
fair referred to under date 1650, came up this year
in strong force. The corporation had usually appointed
the minister of Barnwell, but this year they
appointed another, a fellow of King’s College.
Their right to the nomination was now disputed by
the improprietor and minister of Barnwell. The
corporation resolved to maintain their nominee, and
the opposing parties advertised their intention of
standing on what they regarded as their rights.
Proceedings were accordingly commenced in the
Bishop of Ely’s court. The following year (Sept.
1711) the Vicar of Barnwell published the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Whereas ’tis the resolution of the corporation of
Cambridge, against the present incumbent of Barnwell,
to set up a preacher in Sturbridge Fair; being
led thereinto by artificially persuading some of his
predecessors into an illegal note, against the patron,
his clerks and successors in the said living: and
Sturbridge Fair being in the parish of Little St.
Andrew’s, Barnwell, and the ministers thereof have
(when right and law prevail) time out of mind,
without any disturbance (the said corporation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Cambridge finding alwaies a pulpit) performed the
service of the two Lord’s-days during the said fair,
with their congregation, service-books, vestments,
pulpit ornaments, and parish-clerk, in gratitude for
the collection that hath been there alwaies made,
for the better support of themselves under their
small parochial income, till the last year 1710; for
which intrusion, then, the unwary usurper was censured
in the Bishop’s ecclesiastical court: These do
humbly give notice to the gentlemen of the fair,
that the pulpit not being allowed this year as usual,
and it not being known soon enough to provide
one, the service of the Lord’s day, during this present
fair, will be performed in the parish-church,
morning and evening, by the minister of Barnwell.</p>

<p class="right">Will. Piers.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Piers appears to have carried his point, as
no mention of a Sturbridge fair preacher subsequently
to 1711 occurs in the Corporation books.
Dr. Hurd, Bishop of Worcester, was, whilst fellow
of Emmanuel, preacher at Sturbridge fair.</p>

<p><i>Preaching in the Fair.</i>—The services were performed
during the two Sundays occurring in the
principal period of the fair, both morning and afternoon.
The sermon was preached from a pulpit
placed in the open air, in the centre of the large
square, some 300 by 240 feet, called the <i>Duddery</i>,
where the woollen-drapers, wholesale tailors, and
sellers of second-hand clothes took up their residence,
in spacious booths. In the centre of this
square was formerly a tall maypole, with a vane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
at the top. It was the most orderly part of the
fair.</p>

<p>Ned Ward, in his book already referred to
(1700), mentions this part of the fair, and says there
stands “an old weather-beaten pulpit, where on Sunday
a sermon is delivered for the edification of the
strolling sinners, who give open attention, as in a
field-conventicle” (p. 242).</p>

<p>1718. On the 21st Sept. died, aged 89, Samuel
Newton, one of the Aldermen of Cambridge. By
his will he gave to the town four booths in the
fair, and a sermon in his commemoration was for
many years preached at St. Edward’s before the
mayor and corporation on the Sunday next preceding
the 22nd Sept.</p>

<p>1727. I do not know if there was any speciality
in the procession to proclaim the fair this year.
The following details are given in Cooper’s “Annals
of Cambridge,” under this date. The order was
thus: The Crier in scarlet on horseback; twenty-eight
petty Constables on foot; three drums;
banners and streamers; the Grand Marshal; two
trumpeters; the Town music (twelve in number),
two French horns; the Bellman in state with a
stand, on horseback; four Serjeants at Mace on
horseback; the Town Clerk on horseback. The
Mayor in his robes mounted on a horse richly caprisoned,
led by two footmen called red coats with
white wands. The two representatives in Parliament
on horseback. Twelve Aldermen according
to seniority on horseback (three and three) in their
proper robes, the six seniors having their horses attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
by as many henchmen or red coats with
wands. The twenty-four Common Councilmen,
three and three according to seniority. Eight Dispensers
in their gowns, two and two; four Bailiffs
in their habits (two and two). The Treasurers in
their gowns. The Gentlemen and Tradesmen of
the town.</p>

<p>The procession was followed by a great number
of the boys of the town on horseback, who as soon
as the ceremony of proclaiming was over, rode races
about the place; and on returning to Cambridge
each boy had a cake and some ale at the Town-hall.</p>

<p>This procession was maintained until about 1758,
when it began “to be abridged,” owing as it is said
to the trouble and charge of keeping it in suitable
condition.</p>

<p><i>De Foe’s Description of the Fair.</i>—1723. This
year the fair was visited by Daniel De Foe, and he
gives an account of it which I regard as of great
value. He understood how to grapple with what
he saw, and how to record the results of his inquiry.
I give his description with very small curtailment.
The account was not published until 1724:</p>

<p>I now draw near to Cambridge, to which I fansy
I look as if I was afraid to come, having made so
many Circumlocutions beforehand; but I must yet
make another Digression before I enter the Town;
(for in my way, and as I came in from Newmarket,
about the beginning of September;) I cannot omit,
that I came necessarily through Sturbridge Fair,
which was then in its height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>If it is a Diversion worthy of a Book to treat of
Trifles, such as the Gayety of Bury Fair, it cannot
be very unpleasant, especially to the Trading part
of the World, to say something of this Fair, which
is not only the greatest in the whole Nation, but in
the World; nor, if I may believe those who have
seen them all, is the Fair at Leipsick in Saxony, the
Mart at Frankfort on the Main, or the Fairs at
Nuremberg or Ausburg, any way to compare to
this Fair at Sturbridge.</p>

<p>It is kept in a large Corn-field, near Casterton,
extending from the side of the River Cam, towards
the Road, for about half a Mile square.</p>

<p>If the Husbandmen who rent the Land, do not
get their Corn off before a certain Day in August,
the Fair-Keepers may trample it under foot, and
spoil it, to build their Booths: On the other Hand,
to ballance that Severity, if the Fair-Keepers have
not done their Business of the Fair, and remov’d
and clear’d the field by another certain Day in September,
the Plowmen may come in again, with Plow
and Cart, and overthrow all and trample it into the
Dirt; and as for the Filth, Dung, Straw, &amp;c., necessarily
left by the Fair-Keepers, the Quantity of
which is very great, it is the Farmers Fees, and
makes them full amends for the trampling, riding,
and carting upon, and hardening the Ground.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe all the Parts and Circumstances
of this Fair exactly; the Shops are
placed in Rows like Streets, whereof one is call’d
Cheapside; and here, as in several other Streets, are
all sorts of Trades, who sell by Retale, and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
come principally from London with their Goods;
scarce any trades are omitted, Goldsmiths, Toy-shops,
Braziers, Turners, Milleners, Haberdashers,
Hatters, Mercers, Drapers, Pewterers, China-Warehouses,
Taverns, Brandy-Shops, and Eating-Houses,
innumerable, and all in Tents, and Booths, as
above.</p>

<p>This great Street reaches from the Road, which
as I said goes from Cambridge to Newmarket, turning
short out of it to the Right towards the River,
and holds in a Line near half a Mile quite down to
the River-side: In another Street parallel with the
Road are like Rows of Booths, but larger, and
more intermingled with Wholesale Dealers, and on
one side, passing out of this last Street to the Left
Hand, is a formal great Square, form’d by the
largest Booths, built in that Form, and which they
called the Duddery; whence the name is deriv’d, and
what its Signification is, I could never yet learn,
tho’ I made all possible search into it. [Duddery
is evidently derived from the old word Dudde, signifying
cloth (“Promptorium Parvulorum,” ed.
Way, i. 134). Duds for clothes is still used as a
cant word, and by the Scotch (Bailey’s “Dictionary;”
Glossaries to Burns and Walter Scott).]
The area of this Square is about 80 to 100 yards,
where the Dealers have room before every Booth
to take down, and open their Packs, and to bring
in Waggons to load and unload.</p>

<p>This place is separated, and Peculiar to the Wholesale
Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture. Here the
Booths, or Tents are of a vast Extent, have different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
apartments, and the Quantities of Goods they
bring are so Great, that the Insides of them look like
another Blackwell Hall, being as vast Ware-Houses
pil’d up with Goods to the Top. In this Duddery,
as I have been inform’d, there have been sold
£100,000 worth of Woollen Manufactures in less
than a Week’s time, besides the prodigious Trade
carry’d on here, by Wholesale Men, from London,
and all Parts of England, who transact their Business
wholly in their Pocket-Books, and meeting
their Chapmen from all Parts, make up their
Accounts, receive money chiefly in Bills, and take
Orders: These they say exceed by far the Sales of
Goods actually brought to the Fair, and deliver’d in
Kind; it being frequent for the London Wholesale
Men to carry back orders from their Dealers for
£10,000 worth of Goods a Man, and some much
more. This especially respects those People, who
deal in heavy Goods, as Wholesale Grocers, Salters,
Brasiers, Iron-Merchants, Wine-Merchants, and the
like; but does not exclude the Dealers in Woollen
Manufactures, and especially in Mercery Goods of
all sorts, the Dealers in which generally manage
their Business in this manner.</p>

<p>Here are Clothiers from Hallifax, Leeds, Wakefield
and Huthersfield in Yorkshire, and from Rochdale,
Bury, &amp;c., in Lancashire, with vast Quantities
of Yorkshire Cloths, Kerseyes, Pennistons, Cottons,
&amp;c., with all sorts of Manchester Ware, Fustians,
and things made of Cotton Wool; of which the
Quantity is so great, that they told me there were
near a thousand Horse-Packs of such Goods from that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
side of the Country, and these took up a side and a
half of the Duddery at least; also a part of a street
of Booths were taken up with Upholsterer’s Ware,
such as Tickings, Sackings, Kidderminster Stuffs,
Blankets, Rugs, Quilts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the Duddery I saw one Ware-house or Booth
with six Apartments in it, all belonging to a Dealer
in Norwich Stuffs only, and who they said had
there above £20,000 value in those Goods, and no
other.</p>

<p>Western Goods had their Share here also, and
several Booths were fill’d as full with Serges, Du-Roys,
Druggets, Shalloons, Cantaloons, Devonshire
Kersies, &amp;c., from Exeter, Taunton, Bristol, and
other Parts West, and some from London also.</p>

<p>But all this is still out done, at least in show, by
two Articles, which are the peculiars of this Fair,
and do not begin till the other part of the Fair,
that is to say for the Woolen Manufacture begins
to draw to a Close; these are Wooll, and the Hops,
as for the Hops there is scarce any Price fix’d for
Hops in England, till they know how they sell at
Sturbridge Fair; the Quantity that appears in the
Fair is indeed prodigious, and they, as it were,
possess a large Part of the Field on which the Fair
is kept, to themselves; they are brought directly
from Chelmsford in Essex, from Canterbury and
Maidstone in Kent, and from Farnham in Surrey,
besides what are brought from London, the growth
of those, and other places.</p>

<p>Enquiring why this Fair should be thus, of all
other Places in England, the Center of that Trade;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
and so great a Quantity of so Bulky a Commodity
be carry’d thither so far: I was answer’d by one
thoroughly acquainted with that matter, thus:
The Hops, said he, for this part of England, grow
principally in the two counties of Surrey and Kent,
with an exception only of the town of Chelmsford
in Essex, and there are very few planted anywhere
else.</p>

<p>... I must not omit here also to mention,
that the River Grant, or Cam, which runs close
by the N.W. side of the Fair in its way from
Cambridge to Ely, is Navigable, and that by this
means, all heavy Goods are brought even to the
Fair-Field, by Water Carriage from London, and
other Parts, first to the Port of Lynn, and then in
Barges up the Ouse, from the Ouse into the Cam,
and so, as I say to the very Edge of the Fair.</p>

<p>In like manner great Quantities of heavy Goods,
and the Hops among the rest, are sent from the
Fair to Lynn by Water, and shipped there for the
Humber, to Hull, York, &amp;c., and for New Castle
upon Tyne, and by New Castle, even to Scotland
itself. Now as there is still no planting of Hops
in the North, tho’ a great Consumption, and the
Consumption increasing Daily, this, says my Friend,
is one reason why at Sturbridge Fair there is so
great a Demand for the Hops: He added, that
besides this, there were very few Hops, if any
worth naming, growing in all the Counties even on
this side Trent, which were above forty miles from
London; these Counties depending on Sturbridge
Fair for their supply, so the Counties of Suffolk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Northampton,
Lincoln, Leicester, Rutland, and even to Stafford,
Warwick, and Worcestershire, bought most if not
all their Hops at Sturbridge Fair.</p>

<p>These are the Reasons why so great a Quantity
of Hops are seen at this Fair, as that it is incredible,
considering too, how remote from this
Fair the Growth of them is, as above.</p>

<p>This is likewise a testimony of the prodigious
Resort of the Trading people of all Parts of England
to this Fair; the Quantity of Hops that have
been sold at one of these Fairs is diversley reported,
and some affirm it to be so great, that I dare not
copy after them; but without doubt it is a surprising
Account, especially in a cheap Year.</p>

<p>The next Article brought hither, is Wool, and
this of several sorts, but principally Fleece Wool,
out of Lincolnshire, where the longest Staple is
found; the sheep of those Countries being of the
largest Breed.</p>

<p>The Buyers of this Wool, are chiefly indeed the
Manufacturers of Norfolk and Suffolk and Essex,
and it is a prodigious Quantity they buy.</p>

<p>Here I saw what I have not observ’d in any
other county of England, namely, a Pocket of
Wool.</p>

<p>This seems to be first call’d so in Mockery, this
Pocket being so big, that it loads a whole Waggon,
and reaches beyond the most extream Parts of it,
hanging over both before and behind, and these
ordinarily weigh a Ton or 25 Hundred weight of
Wool, all in one Bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>The Quantity of Wool only, which has been
sold at this Place at one Fair, has been said to
amount to £50,000 or £60,000 in value, some say
a great deal more.</p>

<p>By these Articles a Stranger may make some
guess at the immense Trade carry’d on at this
Place; what prodigious Quantities of Goods are
bought and sold here, and what a confluence of
People are seen here from all Parts of England.</p>

<p>I might go on here to speak of several other sorts
of English Manufactures, which are brought hither
to be sold; as all sorts of wrought Iron, and Brass-Ware
from Birmingham; Edg’d Tools, Knives,
&amp;c., from Sheffield; Glass-Wares and Stockings
from Nottingham, and Leicester; and an infinite
Throng of other things of smaller value, every
Morning.</p>

<p>To attend this Fair, and the prodigious conflux
of People which come to it, there are sometimes
not less than fifty Hackney Coaches, which come
from London, and ply Night and Morning to carry
the People to and from Cambridge; for there the
gross of the People lodge; nay, which is still more
strange, there are Wherries brought from London
on Waggons to plye upon the little River Cam,
and to row People up and down from the Town,
and from the Fair as Occasion presents.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, if the Town of Cambridge
cannot Receive or Entertain the Numbers of
People that come to this Fair; not Cambridge
only, but all the Towns round are full; nay, the
very Barns, and Stables are turn’d into Inns, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
made as fit as they can to Lodge the meaner Sort
of People.</p>

<p>As for the People in the Fair, they all universally
Eat Drink and Sleep in their Booths and
Tents; and the said Booths are so intermingled
with Taverns, Coffee-Houses, Drinking-Houses,
Eating-Houses, Cook-Shops, &amp;c., and all in Tents
too; and so many Butchers, and Hagglers from all
the Neighboring Counties come into the Fair every
Morning with Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Butter, Bread,
Cheese, Eggs, and such things; and go with them
from Tent to Tent, from Door to Door, that
there’s no want of any Provisions of any kind,
either dres’d or undres’d.</p>

<p>In a Word, the Fair is like a well Fortify’d City,
and there is the least Disorder and Confusion (I
believe) that can be seen anywhere, with so great a
Concourse of People.</p>

<p>Towards the latter End of the Fair, and when
the great Hurry of Wholesale Business begins to be
over, the Gentry come in, from all parts of the
County round; and tho’ they come for their diversion;
yet ’tis not a little Money, they lay out;
which generally falls to the share of the Retailers,
such as Toy-shops, Goldsmiths, Brasiers, Ironmongers,
Turners, Milleners, Mercers, &amp;c., and
some loose Coins, they reserve for the Puppet
Shows, Drolls, Rope-Dancers, and such-like, of
which there is no want, though not considerable
like the rest: The last Day of the Fair is the Horse-Fair,
where the whole is closed with both Horse
and Foot-Races, to divert the meaner Sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
People only, for nothing considerable is offered of
that Kind: Thus Ends the whole Fair, and in less
than a week more, there is scarce any sign left that
there has been such a thing there....</p>

<p>I should have mention’d, that here is a Court of
Justice always open, and held every Day in a Shed
built on purpose in the Fair; this is for keeping
the Peace, and deciding Controversies in matters
Deriving from the Business of the Fair: The
Magistrates of the Town of Cambridge are Judges
in this Court, as being in their Jurisdiction, or they
are holding it by special Priviledge: Here they
determine Matters in a Summary way, as is practis’d
in those we call Pye-Powder Courts in other Places,
or as a Court of Conscience; and they have a final
Authority without Appeal.</p>

<p>1729. This year was passed “An Order for the
Registering and Regulating the Prices of Hackney
Coaches at Sturbridge Fair,” which was quite a
formidable document. I give one paragraph only:
... And whereas in pursuance and by virtue of
such immemorial prescription usage and Charters
the said mayor bailiffs and burgesses have from
time to time taken on themselves the regulation
of Hackney Coaches coming to the said fair; and
did heretofore take a toll of 5<i>s.</i> from each coach
coming to the said fair, which of late years they
have omitted to receive in consideration of the
great expenses of such hackney coachmen coming
to the said fair; and did order appoint and establish
the prices to be taken by all coachmen coming
to the said fair and there tendering themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
carry passengers and persons from the town of
Cambridge to the said fair, and from the said fair
to the town of Cambridge, at the price or sum of
3<i>d.</i> ...</p>

<p>The price (after many more recitals) was fixed
at 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>1733. There was a dispute between the University
and the Corporation as to the right to weigh
hops in the fair, as indeed there had been for several
previous years. The matter was referred to the Commissary
of the University and the Recorder of the
Town, who decided in favour of the University. A
paper on the subject was drawn up and published
by Thomas Johnson of Magdalen College, one of
the taxors.</p>

<p>1738. The University published a severe edict
against schismatical congregations at Stourbridge
fair, and appointed Pro-proctors to see it executed.
These measures were occasioned by the fear that
the famous John Henley would erect an oratory in
the fair. He had applied to the Vice-chancellor
for leave to hold an oratory there and had been
refused.</p>

<p>1741. A great gale this year blew down many of
the booths at the fair, and caused great inconvenience
and some damage.</p>

<p>1747. On 29th June the Court of Common
Pleas gave judgment in an action of trespass brought
by James Austin against King Whittred for seizing
his cheese, &amp;c., at this fair in 1745; which
trespass the defendant justified by way of distress
damage feasant made by him as servant to the Corporation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the owners of the fair. The court held
the plea bad in substance, as <i>every person had of
common right a liberty of carrying his goods to a
public fair for sale</i>.—“Willes Reports,” 623.</p>

<p>1748. A company of players from the theatres
in London performed a pantomime called “Harlequin’s
Frolics or Jack Spaniard caught in a Trap,” in
Hussey’s Great Theatrical Booth. There were also
some entertainments of singing and dancing. It
was believed these were permitted in honour of the
approaching peace. But in the following year there
were also companies of players present.—“Annals,”
iv. p. 262, note.</p>

<p>1749. The Land Tax assessed on the fair this
year amounted to £112 7<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Carter the Historian of Cambridge published an
account of the fair this year. I shall only quote
from it such points as have not been mentioned by
De Foe and others. He refers to the name of the
fair being obviously derived from the rivulet called
the Stour, which has a bridge over it near the site
of the fair.</p>

<p>“During the fair Colchester oysters (natives) and
white herrings, just coming into season are in great
request, at least by such as live in the inland part of
the kingdom.” ... “The fair is like a well governed
city.... If any dispute arise between buyer and
seller &amp;c., on calling out ‘Red-coat’ you have instantly
one or more come running to you; and if
the dispute is not quickly decided, the offender is
carried to the said Court [of the fair] where the case
is determined in a summary way....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>1757. Postlethwayt in his “Dictionary of Trade
and Commerce,” 2nd edition, speaks of the fair as
“beyond all comparison the greatest in Britain, and
perhaps in the world”—as it certainly was at this
time.</p>

<p>1759. The Corporation ordered the collector of
the tolls to provide weights and scales for weighing
hops and other goods at the fair, and agreed to indemnify
him against any suit in relation to the
weighing of such goods.</p>

<p><i>Peculiar custom of the Fair.</i>—1762. At this fair
about this date, there was in practice the custom of
“Initiation” or “Christening.” It took place
usually on the evening of the horse-fair day—perhaps
because there was a species of horse-play about the
performance, at the “Robin Hood” inn, famous
in the annals of the fair. The formula was as
follows:—The freshman was introduced to the
elder members in the parlour of the inn, and two
sponsors being previously chosen for him, he was
placed in an armchair, his head uncovered, and his
shoes off. Two vergers, holding staves and lighted
candles, assisted the officiator, who was robed in a
Cantab’s gown and cap, with a bell in one hand and
a book in the other. He commenced the ceremony
by asking “Is this an Infidel?” Answer, “Yes.”
“What does he require?” Answer, “Instruction
(or to be instructed).” “Where are the sponsors?
let them stand forward!” A bowl of punch or
a bottle of wine was placed on the table handy for
the officiator, who then chaunted the following
doggrel:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Over thy head I ring this bell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because thou art an infidel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I know thee by thy smell—<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Chorus.</i> With a hoccius proxius mandamus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">Let no vengeance light on him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">And so call upon him.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With several verses more of the same sort.</p>

<p>Then the officiator turned round and inquired
“Who names this child?” The sponsors replied
“We do,” and then they called the novitiate by
some slang name, as “Nimble-heels,” “Stupid
Stephen,” “Tommy Simper,” or other ludicrous
designation. The officiator then drank and gave
the novice a full bumper, continuing the chaunt:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nimble-heels” henceforward shall be his name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which to confess let him not feel shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether ’fore matter, miss, or dame—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And then the chorus as before. Then,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This child first having paid his dues,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is welcome then to put on his shoes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sing a song, or tell a merry tale—</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">As he may choose.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Chorus and conviviality ending up by a formal
supper. If several novices were offered together,
one ceremony sufficed, with a few necessary verbal
alterations.</p>

<p>1771. In a letter of the Rev. Michael Tyson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
dated <i>Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</i>, Sept. 12th,
this year, occurs the following passage:—“There
is an old and curious plan of Sturbridge Fair in
the mayor’s booth, taken when it was in its splendour,
when its street and square extended all over
those fields by Barmwell. I mean to make a copy
of this, and to draw up an <i>Historiola</i> of the Fair;
but this is too local to be of any entertainment but
to those connected with Cambridge. Thank
Heaven my Deanship ends on Michaelmas day....”—Nichols’
“Literary Anecdotes,” viii. 569.</p>

<p>1778. Violent storm during the fair; Bailey’s
large music booth blown down and many others
injured.</p>

<p>1783. At the Quarter Sessions of Cambridge
held July this year the following order was made:</p>

<p>“Whereas some disputes have arisen, touching
the Intercommon of Stirbridge Fair Green, between
the Commoners of Cambridge, and those of Barnwell
within the said Town, and a suit hath been
instituted in order to try the right of the said Common:
It is this day agreed and ordered, that the
Costs of such suit on the part of the said town of
Cambridge, touching the said intercommon, be paid
and borne by the said town; and that the Town
Clerk be desired to prosecute the said suit, to assert
the right of the inhabitants of the said town to the
said Common.”</p>

<p>It is recorded that some of the scenes at the fair
about this date were of a reprehensible character,
and tradition especially points to a booth raised by
Charles Day, the character of one of whose patrons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
is sketched with a free hand in “Nichols’ Literary
Anecdotes,” viii. p. 540.</p>

<p>1786. There was published “The History and
Antiquities of Barnwell Abbey, and of Sturbridge
Fair” (being a reprint of “Bibliotheca Topographica
Britannica,” No. xxxviii.), from which I
have drawn some of the preceding details.</p>

<p>1789. An interesting and amusing account of
the fair as it appeared in 1789—reign of George
III.—is given in “Reminiscences of Cambridge,”
by Henry Gunning, formerly an Esquire Bedell,
vol. i., pp. 149-158, second edition, London, 1855.</p>

<p class="dropcap">During the performance at the theatre
in the fair, 27th Sept., a cry of “fire”
arose in different parts of the house,
which was greatly crowded. Although
the manager and performers assured the audience
that the alarm was without foundation, and tried
every persuasion to obtain order, a general rush took
place. Some threw themselves over from the upper
boxes into the pit; others were trampled upon and
bruised on the stairs. In the end three girls and a
boy were taken up dead, and many others were
more or less seriously injured. It was supposed the
cry was got up for the purposes of robbery; one
hundred guineas reward was offered for the offenders,
but they escaped detection.</p>

<p>1827. In Hone’s “Year Book” is given a
graphic account of this fair as it had existed within
the memory of the writer, whose “personal recollections
of more than sixty years ago,” are embodied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
therein; from which I condense the following, as
giving a view of its later, but not last stage:</p>

<p>The first booths, on the north side of the road
were occupied by the customary shows of wild
beasts and wild men, conjurors, tumblers and rope-dancers.
Mr. Baker’s company of “comedians”
was respectable; and Lewy Owen the clown, a
young man of good family, who had abandoned
himself to this way of life, full of eccentric wit and
grimace, continually excited broad grins. The late
Mrs. Inchbald was a performer at this fair. There
was a large theatrical booth, occupied by a respectable
company of comedians from Norwich, under
the management of Mr. Bailey, formerly a merchant
of London. He was a portly good-looking man,
of gentlemanly manners and address, the compiler
of the Directory bearing his name—a work of
much merit, containing besides the names of residents
in the several towns, concise yet correct topographical
description of the places: the book has now
become very scarce. Other show booths, occupied
by giants and dwarfs, savage beasts and other
savages, extended with stunning din along this noisy
line. In front of these were the fruit and gingerbread
stalls.... On the south side of the road
opposite to these booths was the cheese fair.
Dealers from various parts took their stands there,
and many tons weight were disposed of. Such as
were fit for the London market were bought by the
cheese factors from thence; and cheese from
Cheshire, Wilts, and Gloster by the gentry and
farmers and dealers from Suffolk, Norfolk, and adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
counties; large quantities of Cottenham
and cream cheeses being brought by farmers from
those counties for sale. Opposite to the east
end of the cheese fair, on the north side of the road
stands an ancient chapel or oratory, no doubt
erected for the devout dealers and others resorting
to this fair, and for such pious travellers as passed
or repassed the ferry to Chesterton [various references
have been made to it; still standing, 1882].
At and nigh to this spot were the wool-fair and the
hop-fair. Large stores of sack-cloths, waggon-tilts,
and such like were near the skin, leather sellers’
and glovers’ row, where the finer articles of leather
and leather gloves were sold. Little edifices of
general convenience were numerous.</p>

<p>At the end of the show-booths and facing the row
began the principal range of booths, called Garlick-row.
This range of shops was well constructed.
Each booth consisted of two rooms; the back
room separated from the shop by a boarded partition
served for a bed chamber and other domestic
purposes, from which a door opened into a field. A
range of booths was generally appropriated to furniture
sellers, ironmongers, silversmiths, jewellers,
japanners and fine cutlery dealers. Another range
to silk-mercers, dealers in muslin, toys and millinery.
Yet another to dealers in Norwich and Yorkshire
manufactures, mercery, lace, hose, fine made shoes,
boots, clogs and patterns (<i>sic</i>). While dealers in
fashionable wares from London, as furs, fans, toys,
&amp;c. occupied a distinct group. A further group was
devoted to oilmen, dealers in pickles, and preserves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
one of whom—Mr. Green from Limehouse—kept a
most important store here. His returns were from
£1,500 to £2,000 during the fair. The father of
the writer from whom I am quoting “kept the
fair” for forty years and upwards, “and usually
brought home £1,000 or more for goods sold and
paid for, besides selling to half that amount on
credit to reputable dealers and farmers.” At the
end of this row stood the dealers in glass-ware, looking-glasses
and small articles of mahogany furniture.
The Inn—the King’s Arms, I believe—was the
common resort of the horse-dealers. Here sat the
<i>Pied-poudre</i> court, having a pair of stocks and a
whipping-post in front, and a strong room underneath.
Close adjoining northward was the oyster
fair. The oysters brought from Lynn were very
large, about the size of a horse’s hoof, and were
opened with pincers; the more delicate from Colchester
and Whitstable were very small. In the
meadow adjoining were the coal fair, pottery fair
and Staffordshire dealers. The greater part of these
articles were delivered from on board vessels which
drew up close to the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Opposite to the oyster fair was a close wherein
the horse fair was kept. The show of beautiful
animals in that place was perhaps unrivalled, unless
in Yorkshire. The finest racers and hunters
from Yorkshire, the most brawny and muscular
draught horses from Suffolk, and from every other
country famous for breeding horses animated the
scene. This horse fair drew together a great concourse
of gentry, farmers and dealers from all parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
of the neighbouring counties, and scores of valuable
animals changed masters in the space of a few
hours. The horse fair was held on the first Friday
after the fair was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Higher up, and about fifty yards from the road
was Ironmongers’ row, with booths occupied by
manufactures from Sheffield, Birmingham, Wolverhampton,
and other parts; and dealers in agricultural
tools, nails, hatchets, saws, and such like
implements. About twenty yards nearer the road
were woollen drapers; and further on, and opposite
to Garlick-row westward, were booths for slop sellers,
and dealers in haubergs, or waggoners’ frocks,
jackets, half-boots, and such like habiliments for
robust ploughmen and farm labourers. Then followed
the hatters’ row, close to which was a very
respectable coffee-house and tavern, fitted up with
neat tables covered with green baize, having glazed
sash-windows and a boarded floor, kept by the proprietor
of Dochrell’s coffee-house in Cambridge,
famed for excellent milk punch. There were also
a number of suttling booths where plain and substantial
dinners were served up in a neat comfortable
style, well cooked and moderately charged,
“except on the horse fair and Michaelmas days,
when an extra sixpence was generally tackt to the
tail of the goose.”</p>

<p>Shoemaker row was at the end of Garlick-row
and consisted of ten or twelve booths. The basket
fair, Tunbridge ware fair, and broom fair, were
behind nearly at the top. In the basket fair were
to be had all kinds of hampers, baskets and basket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
work; hay rakes, scythe-hafts, pitchfork and spade-handles,
and other implements of husbandry, waggon
loads of which were piled up there. In the
Tunbridge ware section were malt, shovels, churns,
cheese-presses and other wooden ware.</p>

<p>The circuit of the fair at the period to which
this account relates was estimated at three miles.
A list of many of the principal London dealers who
attended this fair is appended to this account. Vide
Hone’s “Year Book,” 1841 ed. col. 1539-48. A
rough plan or chart of the fair is there given.</p>

<p>1828. The formal opening of the fair is described
in Wall-Gunning, “The ceremonies observed in
the senate-house of the University of Cambridge.”
Camb. pp. 129-31.</p>

<p>1842. The practice—the origin of which I have
not been able to trace—of the Proctors of the University
giving entertainments at the Midsummer
and Sturbridge fairs was this year discontinued by
a Grace passed 2nd July.</p>

<p>1855. The University, for the last time, “called
the fair” on 18th Sept. this year. The following
form was used on the occasion—very much modified
from that of 1548.</p>

<p><i>Proclamation of the Fair, by the University.</i>—Oyez!
Oyez! Oyez! All persons are desired to
keep silence while Proclamation of this Fair is
being made.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness Prince Albert, Chancellor
of this University Doth in the name of our Sovereign
Lady Queen Victoria strictly charge and
command:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>That all persons who shall repair to this Fair or
the precincts thereof Do keep Her Majesty’s peace,
and make no affrays or outcries whereby any gathering
together of people be made, nor that they wear
any weapons upon pain of imprisonment and loss
of their weapons and further correction as shall be
thought fit by the Officers of the said University.</p>

<p>That all unhonest women, all vagrant and unruly
persons avoid and withdraw themselves from this
Fair and the precincts thereof immediately after this
proclamation, that Her Majesty’s Subjects may be
quieter, and good rule the better maintained upon
pain of imprisonment and further correction at the
discretion of the Officers of this University.</p>

<p>That all Bakers baking bread to sell at this Fair
or the precincts of the same Do bake and sell good
and wholesome bread, and of such goodness as the
law doth require, upon pain of the Statute in that
behalf provided. [Bale (“Declaration of Bonner’s
Articles,” fo. 21 b, about 1550), mentions the
Baker-Boyes crye, as he sat between his Bread-Panners
at the fair, “Buy and beare away; steal
and runne awaye,” &amp;c.]</p>

<p>That all persons who sell Ale or Beer within this
Fair or the precincts of the same Do sell by no
other measures than by Gallon, Pottle, Quart, Pint,
and half-pint, sized and sealed according to the
Standard of this University upon pain and penalty
of the Statute in that behalf provided, and that
every such Victualler and seller of Ale and Beer
have a sign at his door upon pain of Three Shillings
and four pence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>That all persons who sell by weights and measures
any kinds of Victuals, Wares, or Merchandize, that
their weights and their measures be sized and sealed,
and be in all respects according to the Standard of
this University upon pain of the Statute in that behalf
provided.</p>

<p>That all Vintners do sell good and wholesome
wines without mixing or imposition, and that their
wine Pots be sized and sealed according to the
Standard of this University upon pain of three
shillings and four pence for every offence.</p>

<p>That no persons in this Fair Do suffer, keep or
maintain any unlawful gaming in their houses or
grounds, upon pain of the Statute in that behalf
provided.</p>

<p>That no person receive into his house or booth
any person of ill life and conversation or suspected
of the same, upon pain of imprisonment and further
correction as shall be thought fit by the Officers of
this University.</p>

<p>That no person whatsoever sell or offer to put to
sale any kind of wares upon the Sunday upon pain
of imprisonment and further punishment by law
provided: And that no person upon the said day,
especially in the time of service or sermon, receive
any persons into their houses or booths, and there
suffer them to remain idle or drinking upon such
pain and penalty as shall be inflicted upon them by
the officers of this University.</p>

<p>If there be any that will sue for any wares,
Debts, Injuries or Trespasses, or think themselves
wronged in any of the premises, let them make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
complaint to the Chancellor’s Commissary of this
University who will hold and keep Court at the
Great Tiled Booth on — next, the —

may be administered according to the Charters and
Privileges of this University.</p>

<p>1882. The fair still lingers on. Its commercial
greatness has long since passed away—ebbed out of
existence by slow degrees, resulting from many social
and other changes, rather than from any one marked
cause. But, as may be expected after six and a half
centuries (at least) of notable existence, it dies hard.
Three of its features still remain. The horse fair,
always famous, was this year greater than for some
time past. The onion fair is still associated with
Garlick row, while hurdles, gates, and implements
of wood are still prominent. Thus traditions cling.
In “Æsop Dress’d”—a rare collection of fables by
J. Mandeville (4to. 1704, p. 9; should be 33),
there appeared the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“An ass of stupid memory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confes’d, that going to <i>Stourbridge Fair</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His back most brok with wooden ware.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old associations are, however, rapidly crumbling
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>The fair is still proclaimed by the mayor at the
old time of commencing; but the fair is not now
held until a fortnight later and only lasts three
days. There are points in the Proclamation worthy
of note.</p>

<p><i>Proclamation of Sturbridge Fair by the Mayor of
Cambridge.</i>—Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Mr. Mayor
doth strictly charge and command all manner of
persons to keep silence whilst the Fair of Sturbridge
is publicly proclaimed. God save the Queen.</p>

<p>Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Our most Gracious Sovereign
Lady Victoria by the Grace of God of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
Queen Defender of the faith by Mr. Mayor of the
Borough of Cambridge Her Majesty’s Lieutenant
of the said Borough one of Her Majesty’s Justices
of the Peace for the Borough and County of Cambridge
and chief Governor of this Fair Doth strictly
charge and command that all Merchants and other
persons that be repaired or shall or will repair to
this Fair of Sturbridge beginning on the feast of St.
Bartholomew the Apostle (old style) and continuing
until the fourteenth day next after the feast of the
exaltation of the Holy Cross (old style) do keep
Her Majesty’s Peace.</p>

<p>That all idle and evil disposed persons within
this Fair depart the same forthwith.</p>

<p>That no Merchant put to sale or offer to sell
any wares or merchandize but in the usual and
accustomed places for their several wares and merchandizes
appointed.</p>

<p>That Victuallers Tiplers and other persons buy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
no goods or merchandize of any wayfaring man or
other person who shall bring the same to their booths
or houses to sell but only of such as shall be known
unto them to be of honest conversation whom they
shall be always able to have forthcoming upon
demand.</p>

<p>That all Merchants and other persons within this
fair cease from shewing or selling any wares or merchandizes
and from all labour and travel on the
Lord’s day.</p>

<p>And lastly Mr. Mayor giveth to understand that
if any Merchant or other person will sue or complain
touching any cause or matter done and committed
within this Fair or the liberties thereof and
here determinable let him repair to the place accustomed
and there according to the law of the land
the same cause or matter shall be heard and determined.
God save the Queen.</p>

<p class="dropcap">While the presentation of the preceding
details has been essential to the
plan of this work, I desire, by way of
appropriate conclusion, to estimate the
influence of the fair upon the development of
commerce in England, and, in some degree, also in
Europe. I find a most comprehensive review of
this character from the masterly pen of Prof. James
E. Thorold Rogers, M.A., in his great work, the
“History of Agriculture and Prices in England”
(1866, vol. i. pp. 142-4).</p>

<p>After pointing out that the port of Lynn, with
the rivers Ouse, and Cam, were the means by which
water-carriage was made available for goods—an
important point; indeed it may be regarded as certain
that in the middle ages and later, no great fair
could be held far removed from water communication—he
proceeds:</p>

<p>The concourse must have been a singular medley.
Besides the people who poured forth from the great
towns—from London, Norwich, Colchester, Oxford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
places in the beginning of the fourteenth century
of great comparative importance, and who gave
their names, or, in case certain branches of commerce
had been planted in particular London streets, the
names of such streets, to the rows of booths in the
three-weeks’ fair of Stourbridge—there were, beyond
doubt, the representatives of many nations
collected together to this great mart of medieval
commerce. The Jew, expelled from England, had
given place to the Lombard exchanger. The
Venetian and Genoese merchant came with his precious
stock of Eastern produce, his Italian silks and
velvets, his store of delicate glass. The Flemish
weaver was present with his linens of Liege and
Ghent. The Spaniard came with his stock of iron,
the Norwegian with his tar and pitch. The Gascon
vine-grower was ready to trade in the produce of
his vineyard; and, more rarely, the richer growths
of Spain, and, still more rarely, the vintages of
Greece were also supplied. The Hanse towns sent
furs and amber, and probably were the channel by
which the precious stones of the East were supplied
through the markets of Moscow and Novgorod.
And perhaps by some of those unknown courses,
the history of which is lost, save by the relics which
have occasionally been discovered, the porcelain of
the farthest East might have been seen in some of
the booths.</p>

<p>Blakeney, and Colchester, and Lynn, and perhaps
Norwich, were filled with foreign vessels, and
busy with the transit of various produce; and
Eastern England grew rich under this confluence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
trade. How keen must have been the interest with
which the franklin and bailiff, the one trading on
his own account, the other entrusted with his master’s
produce, witnessed the scene, talked of the wonderful
world about them, and discussed the politics of
Europe!</p>

<p>To this great fair came, on the other hand, the
woolpacks, which then formed the riches of England
and were the envy of outer nations. The
Cornish tin-mine sent its produce, stamped with the
sign of the rich earl who bought the throne of the
German Empire, or of the warlike prince who had
won his spurs at Crecy, and captured the French
king at Poitiers. Thither came also salt from the
springs of Worcestershire, as well as that which had
been gathered under the summer sun from the salterns
of the eastern coast. Here, too, might be
found lead from the mines in Derbyshire, and iron,
either raw or manufactured, from the Sussex forges.
And besides these, there were great stores of those
kinds of agricultural produce which, even under the
imperfect cultivation of the time, were gathered in
greater security, and therefore in greater plenty,
than in any other part of the world, except
Flanders.</p>

<p>To regulate the currency, to secure the country
against the loss of specie, and more harmlessly to
prevent the importation of spurious or debased coin,
the officers of the king’s exchange examined into
the mercantile transactions of the foreign traders.
To form a ready remedy against fraud, the mayor
sat at his court “of the dusty feet;” a mixed multitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
were engaged in sale or purchase; the nobles
securing such articles of luxury as were offered them,
or which law and custom assigned to their rank—their
rich robes of peace, their armour from Milan,
their war horses from Spain. The franklin came
for materials for his farm, and furniture for his
house; sometimes even to buy rams in order to improve
the breed of his flock. The bailiffs of college
and monastery were busy in the purchase of clothing.
And on holidays and Sundays, some canon, deputed
from the neighbouring priory, said mass and preached
in the booth assigned for religious worship.</p>

<p>This is certainly a not over-coloured picture of
the past of this once mighty fair. Mr. Cunningham,
in his most excellent work, “The Growth of
English Industry and Commerce” (1882, Cambridge
University Press, p. 164), says:—“By far
the greater part of the commerce of this country
was carried on at such fairs; and <i>Sturbridge</i> Fair
was one of the most important in the whole kingdom,
rivalling it was said the great fair of Nijni
Novgorod, as a gathering of world-wide fame.”
And he adds by way of note:—“In the eighteenth
century it continued to be a most important mart
for all sorts of manufactured goods, as well as for
horses, wool, and hops.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">This is I believe the only fair, or certainly
the only one of any note, ever
held within the walls of the City of
London. Southwark Fair became
vested in the Corporation in the fifteenth century.
I do not propose to write anything more than an
outline history of Bartholomew Fair. Mr. Morley’s
most interesting “Memoir of Bartholomew Fair”
(1859) is available to those who desire more minute
details. But as an institution which existed for
seven hundred years, and more or less illustrates the
social history of the metropolis, and in some sort
its trading customs, during a considerable portion
of that period, it cannot be passed over lightly. I
shall adopt a chronological mode of illustration as,
on the whole, best suited to the end in view.</p>

<p><i>Founding the Priory of Bartholomew</i>, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1102.—In
the reign of Henry I., the Priory, Hospital and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Church of St. Bartholomew, in Smithfield, were
founded by one Rahere, a minstrel of the king, and
“a pleasant witted gentleman.” It seems that
Rahere was determined to this pious work in a fit
of sickness, during a pilgrimage he made to Rome
agreeably to the fashion of the times, when St. Bartholomew
appeared to him, and required him to undertake
the work and perform it in Smithfield. Before
that time Smithfield, or the greater part of it, was called
“the Elms,” because it was covered with elm trees.
FitzStephen says the name of Smithfield is merely a
corruption of “Smooth field,” or plain, which harmonizes
with the fact that the ground was used at
an early period for tilting matches or tournaments,
which were provided for the amusement of the
citizens, who then consisted of most of the noble
families of the land, and who daily took their active
exercise here. These “jousts” or entertainments
were carried out with great splendour.</p>

<p>This monk Rahere, the founder of the Priory,
&amp;c., has been termed the king’s jester, or court
fool. The Cotton MS. records in its quaint language
and spelling that Rahere “ofte hawnted the
Kyng’s palice, and amo’ge the noysefull presse of
that tumultuous courte, enforsed himself with jolite
and carnal suavite: ther yn spectaclis, yn metys, yn
playes, and other courtely mokkys, and trifyllis intrudying,
he lede forth the besynesse of alle the
day.” There always existed at the court in these
early times some one employed as story-teller and
companion in the king’s amusements; and it seems
not to be doubted that Rahere occupied this position—turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
his opportunities of patronage to good
account (as others occupying a like office have done)
for the benefit of his fellow citizens. His memory
is still perpetuated by the Association of “Rahere
Almoners,” who meet at stated periods in the famed
historical precincts of Smithfield.</p>

<p>Rahere became the first Prior of the monastery
he had thus founded, and seems to have established
a fair almost simultaneously, as was indeed the
custom of the age. There appears to have existed
here, even at this early period, a periodical gathering
known as the “King’s Market,” which Mr.
Morley considers may have been held amongst the
trees, while the Priory was built upon the marsh
or smooth-field, around which the fair was held.
The Prior is said—either in consequence of his
zeal for the monastery, or from the old associations
of his former profession—to have gone annually
into the fair, and exhibited his skill as a juggler:
giving the largesses he so received from the spectators
to the treasury of the monastery.—<i>Frost</i>, p. 9.</p>

<p>Rahere also became Lord of the Fair, and his
representative presided as judge in the Court of
Piepowder attached to the fair. This court was
held within the Priory gates. This at all events
was the case down to 1445.</p>

<h3><i>First Charter</i>, 1133.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Prior obtained from the King a
Charter, wherein, after providing for
an independent election of a new prior
by the monks in the event of Rahere’s
death, and after confirming the privileges and
possessions of the Priory, it was declared “I grant
also my firm peace to all persons coming to
and returning from the fair, which is wont to be
celebrated in that place at the Feast of St. Bartholomew;
and I forbid any of the Royal Servants
to implead any of their persons, or without the consent
of the Canons, on those three days, to wit
the eve of the feast, the feast itself, and the day
following, to levy dues upon those going thither.
And let all people in my whole kingdom know that
I will maintain and defend this Church, even as my
crown; and if any one shall presume to contravene
this our Royal privilege, or shall offend the prior,
the canons, clergy or laity of that place, he, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
all who are his, and everything that belongs to him,
shall come into the King’s power.”</p>

<p>In addition to the King’s “firm peace,” and the
usual privileges, it came to be believed that there
were special miracles in store for those who braved
the perils of distant travel in making pilgrimage to
the Festival and Fair of St. Bartholomew. In Mr.
Morley’s book will be found a long enumeration of
these. “What wonder (he asks) if to see the
miracles worked at the celebration of the Feast of
St. Bartholomew, in the first years after the foundation
of his Priory in Smithfield, the people came
from far and near, and were to be found ‘shouldering
each other’ as well as ‘dancing and rejoicing’
in a concourse at the fair”?</p>

<p>1154-86. We have it on the authority of Stow
that Henry II. granted to the Priory the privilege
of a fair to be kept yearly at Bartholomew tide for
three days, to wit the eve, the day, and next
morrow; to which the clothiers of all England and
drapers of London repaired, and had their booths
and standings within the Church Yard of this Priory,
closed in with walls and gates, locked every night,
and watched for safety of men’s goods and wares. A
Court of Piepowder was daily during the fair
holden for debts and contracts. But he adds a note
in regard to the time of the fair—“that forrens
[foreigners] were licensed for three days; the freedmen
so long as they would, which was sixe or seven
dayes.” It is clear that the venerable historian had
mixed and confounded various and distinct events.
I do not find other reference to this charter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Henry II. except by Hone, who says this charter
gave the mayor and aldermen of the City criminal
jurisdiction during the fair. The chief articles of
commerce at the fair about this period were cloth,
stuffs, leather, pewter, and live cattle.</p>

<p>1292. The first dispute between the City of
London and the Priory of St. Bartholomew regarding
the fair arose this year. It was on the subject
of <i>Tolls</i>. The fair as we have already seen had
spread beyond the Prior’s bounds. The Custos of
the City—for in 1288 Edward I. upon a quarrel
with the City seized its liberties, and Ralph
Sandwich was appointed Custos to collect the Tolls
for the Sovereign—applied for half the tolls. The
Prior claimed the whole on the ground of ancient
custom, &amp;c. The King was at Durham, and the
matter coming before him on the approach of the
fair, made the following order:—</p>

<p><i>Dominus Rex &amp;c.</i>—The Lord the King hath
commanded the Custos and Sheriffs in these words:
Edward by the Grace of God, to the Custos and
Sheriffs of London, greeting. Whereas the Prior
of St. Bartholomew, of Smithfield in the suburbs of
London, by the Charters of our progenitors, Kings
of England, claimeth to have a certain Fair there
every year, during three days viz. on the Eve, the
Day, and on the morrow of St. Bartholomew the
Apostle, with all Liberties and Free Customs belonging
to the Fair; a contention hath arisen between
the said Prior and you the said Custos, who sue for us
concerning the use of the liberties of the said Fair,
and the free Customs belonging to it. And hindrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
being made to the said Prior by you the said Custos,
as the said Prior asserteth, to wit, concerning a
Moiety of the Eve and of the whole morrow aforesaid,
concerning this We Will, as well for us as
for the aforesaid Prior, that justice be done as it is
fit, before our Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer,
after Michaelmas day next within a month.
We command you that sufficient security be taken
of the said Prior for restoring to us on the said day
the proceeds of the aforesaid fair, coming from
the moiety of the foresaid Eve and from the
whole morrow, if the said Prior cannot then show
something for himself, why the said proceeds ought
not to belong to us. We command you that ye
permit the same Prior in the meantime, to receive
the foresaid proceeds in form aforesaid; and thereto
you may leave this Brief. Witness myself at Durham
the 9th day of Aug. in the 20th year of our reign.</p>

<p>While the question was thus pending the disputants
grew so warm that the City authorities
arrested some of the monks, and confined them in
the Tun prison on Cornhill. They were released
by command of the King, but thereupon nine
citizens forced the Tun and released all the other
prisoners, by way of resenting the royal interference.
The rioters were imprisoned in their turn,
and a fine of twenty thousand marks was imposed
upon the City; but the civic authorities proposed a
compromise, and, for a further payment of three
thousand marks, Edward consented to pardon the
offenders, and to restore and confirm the privileges
of the City.—<i>Frost</i>, pp. 10-11.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>The result of the reference above ordered to the
Barons of the Exchequer &amp;c. was unfavourable to
the claim of the City, the Charter of the Hospital
was again confirmed. The question of the Tolls
was not indeed finally disposed of; but as it sleeps
for a century or so, we must not now depart from
the course of our record—see 1445.</p>

<p>1305. Another and special incident arose at the fair
of this year. I will quote the eloquent description
of Mr. Morley. On the eve of St. Bartholomew,
the first day of the fair in the year 1305, the traders
and pleasure-seekers, the friars and the jesters,
clothiers, tumblers, walkers upon stilts, hurried
across the grass of Smithfield from the side on which
the fair was being held, to the Gallows under the
Elms, where officers of state and a great concourse
of men awaited a most welcome spectacle. The
priory was indeed built on the site of the gallows;
but in that suburban gathering-place of the people—place
of executions, place of tournaments, place of
markets, place of daily sport, place of the great
annual fair—one gallows-tree was not enough to
satisfy a justice that loved vengeance and had slight
regard for life. Under the Elms of which already
mention has been made (Cow Lane now represents
their site)—under the Elms we read in a close roll, so
early as the fourth year of Henry III., gallows were
built “where they had stood before.” An execution
during fair time on that ancient exhibition ground,
was entertainment rarely furnished to the public:
for the Church forbade, among other work, fulfilment
of the sentence of the law on any holiday of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
festival; <i>and a fair was a Saint’s Holiday</i>. But
on this occasion, law was eager to assure the execution
of its vengeance. The redoubtable Wallace,
hero of the Scottish people, had been taken.
The rugged patriot, strong of heart and strong of
hand, had been brought to London in his chains
the day before the fair was opened, and on the
day of the opening of the fair was arraigned and
condemned at Westminster as a traitor, and without
even a day’s respite, at once sent on to his death.
Under the Elms, therefore, in Smithfield, stood all
the concourse of Bartholomew fair, when William
Wallace was dragged thither in chains at the tails
of horses, bruised, bleeding, and polluted with the
filth of London. The days had not yet come when
that first part of the barbarous sentence on high
treason was softened by the placing of a hurdle
between the condemned man and the mud and flint
over which he was dragged. Trade in the fair was
forgotten while the patriot was hanged, but not to
death; cut down, yet breathing, and disembowelled,
mummers and merchants saw the bowels burnt
before the dying hero’s face, then saw the executioner
strike off his head, quarter his body, and dispatch
from the ground five basket-loads of quivering
flesh, destined for London, Berwick, Newcastle,
Aberdeen and Perth. Then, all being over, the
stilt-walkers strode back across the field, the woman
again balanced herself head downwards on the points
of swords; there was mirth again round the guitar
and tambourine, the clothiers went back into the
Churchyard, and the priest perhaps went through a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
last rehearsal with the man who was to be miraculously
healed in church on the succeeding day!—“Memorials
of Bartholomew Fair,” pp. 71-2.</p>

<p>1321. In this, the 14th Edward II. there was
issued a writ inquiring by what warrant the Priory
held its rights over Bartholomew Fair. This writ
was part of the machinery of a general inquisition
into the rights claimed by subjects, which had in
many cases been alienated without license from the
crown, and often gave rise to private oppression of
the people. The Prior pleaded the Royal Charters
of his house and testified upon oath that his predecessors
had held such a three-day fair since times
beyond the reach of memory. The justification
satisfied the King’s Exchequer.</p>

<p>1334. In this, the 7th Edward III. a new
Charter of the fair was granted to the Hospital of
St. Bartholomew confirming the old rights and
reassuring the King’s firm peace to all persons travelling
towards, staying in, or returning from the fair;
also forbidding any servants of a royal or episcopal
court to implead any of their persons “or without
the consent of the prior and canons on those three
days ... to exact tolls either without the City or
within it, whether in the passage of roads or bridges,
but let all proceeds that arise according to the
usage of fairs belong to the canons of the aforesaid
church.” This latter provision clearly had reference
to the claims of the City. See 1376.</p>

<p>It was a review of these and similar facts which
induced Mr. Morley to remark that in early times,
if not from the beginning, there were practically two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
fairs held in Smithfield—one within and one without
the Priory bounds. The outer fair, he adds, “was
possibly composed of the mere pleasure givers and
pleasure seekers, who attended on the company of
worshippers and traders then attracted to the priory,
and whose tents were pitched in the open market of
Smithfield, outside the gates, not [? but] free from
toll to the Church. Within the gates, and in the
Priory churchyard, the substantial Fair was held”
(pp. 61-2).</p>

<p>1348. In the preceding century license had been
given by Edward I. to the brethren of the Hospital
of St. Bartholomew in Smithfield to cover with
stone and wood the stream running through the
midst of the hospital to Holborn Bridge, “on account
of the too great stench proceeding from it.”
The large influx of persons at the Fair must have
made matters worse. In the year 1348 the pestilence
broke out in London at the time of the fair,
and ended about fair-time in the following year.
During the interval between fair and fair, so great
had been the mortality that, in addition to the
burials in churches and other churchyards, <i>fifty
thousand</i> bodies had been buried in the graveyard
of the Carthusians, adjoining the fair ground. Mr.
Morley may well assume that it must have been the
great object of interest and terror to the slender
throng of men who hardly dared assemble; and
who—missing from the annual crowd so many
familiar faces—spoke to each other with a feeble
hope of the apparent lifting of the plague. “What
mirth was there in that handful of the living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
camped so near the silent congregation of the dead?”
See 1593.</p>

<p><i>New Charter.</i>—Edward III. under date August
1, 1376, granted to the Prior, &amp;c., the following
charter, which has heretofore escaped observation,
probably because in the records of the City it had
been endorsed as a “Writ to proclaim the Fair of
the Prior of Saint Bartholomew in Smethefelde,”
whereas it is seen to be a most important grant or
confirmation of previous charters. I give a full
translation, marking certain passages with italics:—Edward
by the grace of God King of England and
of France, and Duke of Ireland, to the Mayor
and sheriffs of London and Middlesex, Greeting.
Whereas among other liberties and quittances
granted to our beloved in Christ the Prior and
Convent of the church of Saint Bartholomew of
Smethefelde, London, by charters of our progenitors,
former Kings of England, which we have
confirmed, it is granted to the same—That they may
have all manner of freedom for ever, and that the
church aforesaid shall be as free as any church in
the whole of England that is most free, and as free
as our demesne chapel, which church also our said
progenitors granted to will, maintain and defend in
manner like as our very crown; and, moreover,
<i>they gave firm peace to those coming to the Fair that
is much frequented at the feast of Saint Bartholomew</i>
in the said place of Smethefelde, So that in those
three days’ space, namely, the eve of the feast, or
the day itself, or the day following, from such
comers, whether without the City or within, <i>or in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
passing along the ways or over the bridges, no one shall
require any customs</i>, but that all things which arise
out of the right of fairs shall be to the said church
and the Canons serving God there, and that is any
one shall presume in any thing to contravene this
Royal privilege, or shall offend the Prior Canons or
laymen of that place, he and his men, and all that
he has, shall devolve into our Royal right: and
also lord Richard, formerly King of England, our
progenitor, by his letters ordered the then sheriffs
of London and Middlesex, and all their bailiffs,
that they should neither vex nor allow to be vexed
the foresaid Canons of the church of saint Bartholomew
(which is our demesne chapel) concerning their
fair which they have at the feast of the same church,
nor require from those coming to the Fair of saint
Bartholomew for the purpose of selling or buying,
whether without the City or within, or also in passing
along the ways or over the bridges, customs or
services, or anything that may diminish the liberty
of the said church of saint Bartholomew—as in the
charters, letters and our confirmation aforesaid more
fully is contained: <i>and now we have understood that
some by sinister covin and conspiracy previously had
between them have knavishly designed to hinder merchants
and others who wish to come and have been
wont to come to the said fair with their merchandise,
so that they cannot come thither and do their business
therein</i>, as well to the loss of them the Prior and
Convent and overthrow and weakening of their
right as to the manifest letting and hindrance of
our common people: We, duly heeding the fervent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
devotion and affection which our foresaid progenitors
had towards the said church, as by the charters
and letters aforesaid more fully doth appear, and
willing (as we are bounden) to maintain and defend
the said fair, <i>which for so long time hath endured</i>
and was granted by our said progenitors to the
honour of God in subvention of Holy Church, and
all other rights and privileges, lest in our time they
perish, have taken into our special protection and
defence the said Prior and Canons, and their men
and servants, and merchants whomsoever and others
wishing to come with their goods and things to the
said fair, there tarrying and therefrom returning
whither they will; and so we command you to
maintain, protect and defend the said Prior and
Canons, their men and servants, merchants and
others whomsoever coming to the said fair with
their goods and things, there tarrying and therefrom
returning, and to permit the Prior and Convent
to hold their said fair in form aforesaid, and to
receive and have freely and without any hindrance,
from those coming to the said fair and returning
therefrom, <i>the customs and all other the profits which
pertain to them in right of the said fair</i> according to
the form of the charters, letters and confirmation
aforesaid, and as they ought to hold the same fair
and to have and receive the customs and other
things which pertain to that fair, and as they and
their predecessors have until now held that fair and
have been wont to have and receive the customs
and other things which to that fair pertain. And,
concerning any pleas or other things to the said fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
for the said three days appertaining, do you in no
wise intermeddle, neither requiring any thing for
customs and other things to that fair appertaining,
nor hindering, molesting, nor in any way aggrieving
the Prior and Canons of the said place as to the
receiving of the customs and profits aforesaid, nor,
as much in you lies, permitting them to be molested
or aggrieved. And if any shall presume to diminish
the customs and rights of the said fair, then be you
in aid to the said Prior and Canons, or their bailiffs
of the said fair, when hereupon you shall be requested
by them or any one of them, by such ways
and methods as shall seem to you the more expedient,
to compel and distrain those who would
diminish the said customs and rights to yield and
pay the said customs and rights to the said Prior
and Convent: and this do you in no wise omit.
And, that those all and every the premises may
come to the knowledge of all, and that no one, of
what state or condition soever he be, under grave
forfeiture to us, and under the peril incumbent
thereon, may presume in any manner to practise
any covin or any other acts calculated to disturb in
any way that fair or the profit of the fair, or the
merchants or others, so that they cannot lawfully,
without damage and in peace come to that fair with
their merchandise, and do their business there, and
return therefrom, do you cause the same to be
publicly proclaimed, observed and held within your
bailiwick and districts, where it shall seem to you
most expedient, as often as and when hereupon by
the said Prior and Convent, or any one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
you shall on our behalf be requested. Witness Ourself
at Westminster the first day of August in the
fiftieth year of our reign of England, but of our
reign of France the thirty-seventh. Faryngton.</p>

<p>¶ This proclamation was made.</p>

<p><i>Miracle Plays.</i>—This Fair of St. Bartholomew
was long the scene of “miracle plays.” The Company
of Parish Clerks—an incorporated company or
gild who had charge of the records, the burials, and
afterwards of the births in London, during a very
long period—played at Skinners’ Well (near Smithfield)
before Richard II. and his Queen and Court,
towards the close of the fourteenth century; and
early in the following they played before Henry IV.
at the same place, during eight days, “Matter from
the Creation of the world.” The early plays at this
fair are believed to have been representations of
great miracles ascribed to St. Bartholomew. Later
came the “mysteries,” and finally the “moralities,”
out of which our modern drama has been developed.
All these in their turns were presented at this once
famous fair.</p>

<p><i>Slaves.</i>—In this same Fair of Smithfield, as well
before as after the period upon which I am now
writing, men and women—<i>i.e.</i>, slaves and captives—were
sold among the articles of merchandise. And
on a part of the site over which the fair extended,
after the accession of Henry IV., men and women
were burnt alive as heretics. The martyr fires were
usually kindled on that spot of ground outside the
Priory gates, over which the lighter portion of the
fair spread—ground occupied by the holiday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
makers, and the tumblers, jesters, and dancers by
whom they were entertained.</p>

<p><i>Tolls.</i>—1445. At the close of the thirteenth century
there had arisen a dispute between the City of
London and the Prior regarding the tolls of this
Fair, which was then decided in favour of the
Priory. When the matter came up for adjudication
again does not seem clear. The fair had continued
to grow, and its greatest expansion was in the
direction of the City. Indeed, at this or a later
period, it extended down the West side of Aldersgate
nearly as far as St. Martin’s-le-Grand, or to St.
Paul’s itself. On the other side the jurisdiction of
the City extended only to Smithfield Bars. In
1399 Henry IV. had granted to the Citizens of
London the office of gathering tolls in Smithfield.
Probably in consequence of this arrangements were
come to between the Priory and the City. Certain
is it that forty-six years later, or in 1445 (23rd
Henry VI.), four persons were appointed by the
Court of Aldermen as keepers of Bartholomew
Fair and of the Court of Piepowder. In that
Court, therefore, the City then became represented
as joint lord of the Fair with the Priory, the lordship
of the City being founded on its right over
the ground beyond the jurisdiction of the Canons.
See 1538 and 1593.</p>

<p><i>Dissolution of Monasteries.</i>—1538. This is an
eventful year in the history of the Fair—the Dissolution
of the Monastery was declared. The Fair
itself indeed remained—it was the Priory which
created it that had melted away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the fair as it had existed during the
four centuries passed since its origin—but many of
the details of which I have necessarily passed over
in the preceding outline—we may adopt the picture
thus freely drawn by Mr. Morley: Thus we have
in the most ancient times of the Fair a church full
of worshippers, among whom were the sick and
maimed, praying for health about its altar; a graveyard
full of traders, and a place of jesting and
edification, where women and men caroused in the
midst of the throng; where the minstrel and the
story-teller and the tumbler gathered knots about
them; where the sheriff caused new laws to be
published by loud proclamation in the gathering
places of the people; where the young men bowled
at nine pins, while the clerks and friars peeped at
the young maids; where mounted knights and
ladies curvetted and ambled, pedlars loudly magnified
their wares, the scholars met for public wrangle,
oxen lowed, horses neighed, and sheep bleated
among their buyers; where great shouts of laughter
answered to the Ho! Ho! of the devil on the
stage, above which flags were flying, and below
which a band of pipers and guitar beaters added
music to the din. That stage also—if ever there
was presented on it the story of the Creation—was
the first wild-beast show in the fair: for one of the
dramatic effects connected with this play, as we read
in an ancient stage direction, was to represent the
creation of beasts by unloosing and sending among
the excited crowd as great a variety of strange
animals as could be brought together; and to create<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
the birds by sending up a flight of pigeons. Under
foot was mud and filth, but the wall that pent the
city in shone sunlit among the trees; a fresh breeze
came over the surrounding fields and brooks, whispering
among the elms that overhung the moor
glittering with pools, or from the Fair’s neighbour,
the gallows! Shaven heads looked down on the
scene from the adjacent windows of the buildings
bordering the Priory enclosure; and the poor
people whom the friars cherished in their hospital,
made holiday among the rest. The curfew bell of
St. Martin’s-le-Grand, the religious house to which
William the Conqueror had given with its charter
the adjacent moorland, and within whose walls there
was a sanctuary for loose people, stilled the hum of
the crowd at nightfall, and the Fair lay dark under
the starlight.</p>

<p>Change produces change; and so other events
followed at this period. For instance, the disputations
of the scholars in the Mulberry Garden at the
time of the Fair ceased after the suppression of the
Monastery. John Stow had witnessed these when
a lad, and he furnishes the following account of
the same, and of some events preceding: “As for
the meeting of the schoolmasters on Festival Days
at Festival Churches, and the disputing of the
scholars logically, &amp;c., whereof I have before spoken,
the same was long since discontinued; but the arguing
of the schoolboys about the principles of grammar
hath been continued even till our time; for I
myself, in my youth, have yearly seen, on the eve
of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, the scholars of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
divers Grammar schools repair unto the Churchyard
of St. Bartholomew ... where upon a bank
boarded about under a tree, some one scholar hath
stepped up, and there hath opposed and answered
till he were by some better scholar overcome and
put down; and then the overcomer taking the place
did like as the first. And in the end the best opposers
and answerers had rewards, which I observed
not but it made good schoolmasters and also good
scholars diligently against such times to prepare
themselves for the obtaining of this garland. I remember
there repaired to these exercises amongst
others, the masters and scholars of the free schools
of St. Paul’s in London, of St. Peter’s at Westminster,
of Thomas Acon’s Hospital, and of St.
Anthonie’s Hospital; whereof the last named commonly
presented the best scholars and had the prize
in those days. This priory of St. Bartholomew
being surrendered to Henry the Eighth, those disputations
of scholars in that place surceased; and
was again, only for a year or twain, revived in the
Cloister of Christ’s Hospital, where the best scholars,
then still of St. Anthonie’s school, howsoever the
same be now fallen both in number and estimation,
were rewarded with bows and arrows of silver, given
to them by Sir Martin Bower, goldsmith. Nevertheless
however, the encouragement failed—the
scholars of St. Paul’s meeting with those of St. Anthonie’s
would call them Anthonie’s Pigs, and they
again would call the others Pigeons of Paul’s because
many pigeons were bred in St. Paul’s Church,
and St. Anthonie was always figured with a pig following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
him; and mindful of the former usage, did
for a long season disorderly provoke one another
in the open street with ‘<i>Salve</i> tu quoque, placet
mecum disputare?’—‘Placet.’ And so proceeding
from this to questions in grammar, they usually fell
from words to blows with their satchels full of
books, many times in great heaps, that they troubled
the streets and passengers; so that finally they were
restrained with the decay of St. Anthonie’s school.”</p>

<p>It was during this reign of Henry VIII. that
Grotwell (or Cartwell), himself a common hangman—for
there were then many of this occupation,
and plenty of employment—was hanged with two
others, for robbing a booth at the Fair. They were
executed in the wrestling place at Clerkenwell.</p>

<p>I may resume the historical narration. When the
King had taken the estates of the greater monasteries,
they were put under the management of a Royal
Commission, with Sir Richard Rich—under the
style of Chancellor of the Court of Augmentations—at
its head. The Prior’s house became Lord Rich’s
town mansion; and with this mansion in Great St.
Bartholomew there had been assigned to him and
his for ever, the Close of the said late monastery or
priory called Great St. Bartholomew Close, and all
the limits and precincts of the said Close; also all
those closes, edifices, called the fermery, the dorter,
the frater, the cloisters, the gallery, the hall, the
kitchen, the buttery, the pantry, the old kitchen,
the woodhouse, the garner, and the Prior’s stable, of
the said late monastery and priory belonging; and
also all that water and the aqueduct and water-course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
coming from the conduit-head of St. Bartholomew
in the manor of Canonbury.</p>

<p>By the same Letters Patent the King farther
granted to Sir Richard Rich, knight, his heirs and
assigns, “all that Our Fair and Markets, commonly
named and called Bartholomew Fair, holden and to
be holden every year within the aforesaid Close
called Great St. Bartholomew Close, and in West
Smithfield aforesaid to continue yearly for three
days,” &amp;c. And also all the stallage, piccage, toll,
and customs of the same Fair and Markets; and
also all our Courts of Piepowders within the same;
also the scrutiny of weights and measures and things
exposed to sale, and the Assize of bread, wine, and
ale, and other victuals. This grant included the
tolls of the Cloth Fair, but not, of course, the rights
of the City to the tolls for the fair outside St. Bartholomew’s
enclosure.</p>

<p><i>Growth of London.</i>—1590. During the reign of
Elizabeth various attempts had been made to stop
the growth of London. Proclamations had been
issued forbidding under heavy displeasure the building
of new houses. But the Elizabethan era was
an important one in the development of commerce,
as it had been in the fostering of learning; and with
the development of commerce there came a greater
influx of strangers into the city. Thus it came
about that more houses in the city were imperative.
It was found that the lines of trade marked at Bartholomew
Fair by the standings of the clothiers and
others, would yield more money as streets of houses
than as streets of booths, and so, before the close of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the century, as Stow tells us, “notwithstanding all
proclamations of the prince, and also the act of
parliament, in place of booths within the churchyard
(only let out in the fair time and closed up all
the year after) be many large houses built, and the
north wall towards Long Lane taken down, and a
number of tenements are there erected for such as
will give great rents.” This last line of trading-houses
was substituted for the profitless dead wall.
Parallel with it, through the ground vacant of building
north of the church, which that wall had enclosed,
parallel also with one of the church walls, a
street of considerable houses occupied the site and
kept the name of Cloth Fair.</p>

<p><i>Plague.</i>—1593 (53rd of Elizabeth). The plague
being now prevailing in the city, the queen issued a
proclamation on 6th August, about three weeks
before the usual time of the fair, in substance as
follows:—Whereas there was a general resort of all
kinds of people out of every part of the realm to
the said fair; but that (on this occasion) in the
usual place of Smithfield there should be no manner
of market for any wares kept, nor any stalls or
booths for any manner of merchandise, or for
victuals, suffered to be set up; but that the open
space of the ground called Smithfield, be only occupied
with the sale of horses and cattle, and of stall
wares, as butter, cheese, and such like in gross, and
not by retail, the same to continue for the space of
two days only.</p>

<p>And for the vent of woollen cloths, kerseys, and
linen cloth, to be all sold in gross and not by retail;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
the same should be brought within the close-yard of
St. Bartholomew (afterwards known as the Cloth
Fair) where shops were there continued (<i>i.e.</i> not
deserted by reason of the plague) and have gates
to shut the same place in the nights, and then such
to be offered to sale, and to be bought in gross and
not by retail; the same market to continue but
three days—that is to say Even, the Day of St.
Bartholomew and the Morrow after.</p>

<p>And that the sale and vent of leather be kept in
the outside of the ring of Smithfield, as had been
accustomed, without erecting of any shops or
booths for the same, or for any victualler or other
occupier of any wares whatsoever.</p>

<p>And that notice hereof be given to such of H.
M.’s good subjects as for lack of knowledge of this
H. M.’s princely ordonnance might resort to London
to sell or buy small wares by retail, and there
receive infection, and carry the same into their countries,
H. M. commanded that the Lord Mayor of
London should cause this proclamation to be presently
published in all the usual places in the City,
in the time of two or three market days, and to be
also Proclaimed by the Sheriffs of Middlesex, Kent,
Surrey, and Essex, in some places of those Counties
near to the said City, whereby none might resort
to the City at this Feast of St. Bartholomew, by
pretence of any Fair, but such as should have cause
to sell or buy the commodities in gross.</p>

<p>Imprisonment, without bail, during the Queen’s
pleasure, or further punishment, was to be the
penalty for the infraction of this ordinance. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Morley, reviewing this proclamation, says the inference
to be drawn from it was that the fair, as a
place of wholesale commerce, was not to be suppressed
without more injury to trade than the fear of
plague would force the Queen’s advisers to inflict.
But this consideration must be qualified by the fact
that the chief risk came from the throng of pedlers,
hawkers, stall-keepers, showmen, and holiday-makers
from the country round about; and that the soberer
resort of merchants to the fair, while it was certainly
in one respect a greater good, was in the other respect
also a lesser evil. Also, there was a wealthy
nobleman at court unwilling to part with a year’s
tolls from the Cloth Fair and the Close, and able to
urge actively, from motives of self-interest, considerations
that were, at the same time, not wanting
in justice.</p>

<p>1596. A formal agreement was made between
Lord Rich and the Corporation of London, establishing
a composition of the tolls of the fair; and,
as to jurisdiction, placing both parties nearly in the
relative position occupied by the Priory and the

<p><i>A Foreigner’s View of the Fair.</i>—1598. Paul
Hentzner, a German tutor, travelled this year
through Germany, France, Italy, and England,
and kept an “Itinerarum,” of which many editions
have been published. I quote the following description
of Bartholomew Fair from the Aungervyle
Society’s translation (1881):—“It is worthy of
observation that every year upon St. Bartholomew’s
Day, when a fair is held, it is usual for the Mayor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
attended by the twelve principal Aldermen, to walk
in a neighbouring field dressed in his Scarlet Gown,
and about his neck a Golden Chain, to which is
hung a Golden Fleece, and besides that particular
ornament, which distinguished the most noble Order
of the Garter ... himself and they on horseback;
upon their arrival at a place appointed for that
purpose, where a tent is pitched, the mob begin to
wrestle before them, two at a time; the conquerors
receive rewards from the magistrates. After this is
over, a parcel of live rabbits are turned loose among
the crowd, which are pursued by a number of boys
who endeavour to catch them, with all the noise
they can make. While we were at this show, one
of our company, Tobias Salander, Doctor of Physic,
had his pocket picked of his purse, with nine
crowns <i>du soleil</i>, which without doubt was so cleverly
taken from him by an Englishman who always kept
close to him, that the Doctor did not the least perceive
it.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">The plague was again threatening the
City, and James I. issued a proclamation,
dated from Hampton Court, 8th
August, ordaining that for the “desire
of preventing an universal contagion among
our people,” that (<i>inter alia</i>) Bartholomew Fair
should not be holden, “nor anything appertaining
unto them, at the times accustomed, <i>nor any time
till they shall be licensed by us</i>.” These last words
might have been held to imply more than was
directly understood.</p>

<p><i>Proclamation by City of London.</i>—1604. The
arrangement of 1596 prepared the way for the
Corporation taking the active control of the fair.
Hence among the Orders of my Lord Mayor, the
Aldermen, and the Sheriffs for their meetings and
wearing of their apparel through this year, was the
following:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">On Saint Bartholomew’s Even for the
Fair in Smithfield.</span>—The Aldermen meet my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Lord and the Sheriffs at the Guildhall Chapel, at
two of the Clock after dinner, in their violet gowns
lined, and their horses, without cloaks, and there
hear Evening Prayer; which being done, they
take their horses and ride to Newgate, and so forth
to the gate entering in at the Cloth Fair, and there
make a Proclamation,” which was as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proclamation.</span>—The Right Hon. the Lord
Mayor of the City of London, and his right
worshipful Bretheren the Aldermen of the said
City, streightly charge and command, on the behalf
of our Sovereign Lord the King, that all
manner of persons, of whatsoever estate, degree,
or condition they be, having recourse to this fair,
keep the Peace of our said Sovereign Lord the
King.</p>

<p>That no manner of persons make any congregation,
conventicle, or affrays, by the which the same
peace may be broken or disturbed, upon pain of
imprisonment and fine, to be made after the discretion
of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen.</p>

<p>Also, that all manner of sellers of wine, ale, or
beer, sell by measures ensealed, as by gallon, pottle,
quart and pint, upon pain that will fall thereof.</p>

<p>And that no person sell any bread, but if it keep
the assize, and that it be good and wholesome for
man’s body, upon pain that will fall thereof.</p>

<p>And that no manner of person buy nor sell but
with true weights and measures, sealed according to
the Statute in that behalf made, upon pain that will
fall thereof.</p>

<p>And that no manner of person, or persons take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
upon him, or them, within this Fair to make any
manner of arrest, attachment, summons, or execution,
but if it be done by the officer of this City,
thereunto assigned, upon pain that will fall thereof.</p>

<p>And that no person or persons whatsoever, within
the limits and bounds of this fair, presume to break
the Lord’s Day in selling, showing, or offering for
sale, or in buying or offering to buy, any commodities
whatsoever, or in sitting, tippling, or drinking
in any tavern, inn, alehouse, or cook’s-house, or in
doing any other thing that may lead to any breach
thereof, upon the pain and penalties contained in
the several acts of parliament, which will be severely
inflicted upon the breakers hereof.</p>

<p>And finally, that whatever person soever find
themselves aggrieved, injured or wronged by any
manner of person in this Fair, that they come with
their plaints before the Stewards of this Fair,
assigned to hear and determine pleas, and they will
minister to all parties justice, according to the laws
of the Land and the Customs of this City. God
save the King!</p>

<p>Then, the mayor, sheriffs and aldermen, sitting
on horseback, robed in their violet gowns, having
again made this proclamation at a point between
the City Fair and that owned by the Warwick or
Holland family (as successors of Sir Richard Rich?),
ride through the Cloth Fair, and so return back
again, through the Churchyard of Great St. Bartholomew’s
to Aldersgate, and thence home again
to the Lord Mayor’s house.</p>

<p>Tradition declares that the mayor, when he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
read the Proclamation, drank ale from a silver
flagon, and that thereupon the bustle and business of
the fair began. I believe as a matter of fact the
proclamation was usually read by the Lord Mayor’s
attorney, and repeated after him by the sheriff’s
officer, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen,
and sheriffs. The officers of the Lord
Mayor’s household afterwards dined at the Sword-bearer’s
table. This may have become the custom
at a later date. See 1688.</p>

<p><i>Merchant Taylors’ right of search.</i>—1609. An
incident occurred this year which raised the question
of jurisdiction concerning an important function
which had heretofore been deemed of much consequence.
Immediately before the fair of this year
the Drapers questioned the right of search, for
cloth pieces of insufficient length or quality, as
exercised by the Merchant Taylors. What followed
is shown by the records of the last-named company.
Its clerk was ordered thereupon to attend Drapers’
Hall on the next court day with a message to the
following purport, viz., That the Merchant Taylors’
Company had right to search, and that they
had quietly enjoyed the same since the 27th of
Henry VI., being above 150 years past, and still
earlier, as by the Merchant Taylors’ records appeared,
wherein is mentioned a lengthened lawsuit
between them and the Drapers about the same
question of right of search, when a sentence was
passed for the Merchant Taylors. There is in
1612 a note of a dinner at Merchant Taylors’
Hall “for the search on St. Bartholomew’s Eve.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>The Drapers were incorporated as a Guild in
1364. In their charter was a special exemption
made against any prohibitions to be exercised by
the Company regarding the sale of cloth by any
who were not free drapers, in favour of the King’s
beloved in God, the Prior of St. Bartholomew’s, in
West Smithfield, and other lords who had fairs in
the suburbs of London. A draper meant originally
one who made the cloth he sold. It was the
London designation for clothier, a very few
members of the Drapers’ Company being resident
beyond the limits of the City. Therefore, say the
old writers, that Bartholomew Fair was frequented
by “the clothiers of England and the drapers of
London.” Mercers especially frequented fairs and
markets, where their standings were gay with haberdashery,
toys, and even drugs and spices, the small
articles of traffic on which they throve. Mercers
attending the French fairs towards the close of the
thirteenth century paid only half-toll when they
were not stall keepers, but exposed their wares on
the ground. They, and the class of pedlers to
which they were allied, may have enjoyed a like
privilege in England. But while many of the
mercers were thus of the brotherhood of Autolycus,
others dealt largely in silk and velvet, and
abandoned to the haberdasher traffic in small articles
of dress. Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of
London, was a mercer.—<i>Vide Morley</i>, p. 95.</p>

<p><i>Paving the Streets.</i>—1614. This was an important
year in the annals of Smithfield. It passed
from its old and normal condition of mud, into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
clean and paved enclosure, such as was familiar to
many of us before the new market buildings were
erected in 1866. Other changes had preceded. It
was not until 1608 that the City had obtained a
grant of the ground of the late Priory of St. Bartholomew,
which had been constituted into a parish
after the dissolution. Again, while it had ceased
some time before to be the scene of the morning
performances of the common hangman—Tyburn
(itself afterwards absorbed in May Fair) having succeeded
to the distinction; it had still remained the
<i>locus</i> of a far more savage form of persecution. The
ashes of the last martyr fire had burned out in 1611—the
victim being Bartholomew Leggatt, a pious
Unitarian, burnt for distrust of the Athanasian
and Nicene creeds, by the order of James I. at the
sentence of John King, newly-made Bishop of
London!</p>

<p><i>The Drama.</i>—As if more prominently to mark
the transition state last indicated, and perchance also
as a memento, that in the very place had been
enacted (under the patronage of and for the purposes
of the Church) the first drama that England
had ever seen; and which had step by step progressed
from mysteries to miracle plays, thence on
to moralities, and was now advancing to the state of
taking an independent stand as a National Drama—as
if, I say, to commemorate this circumstance
with emphasis, “rare Ben Jonson” produced his
celebrated comedy of “Bartholomew Fair,” one of
the chief features in which is the vivid painting of
the characters through whom the satirist portrays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
the follies of the fair. They are many and various;
each one planned to bring into prominence one of
the characteristics of the motley gathering. Competent
authorities have declared this to be equal to
any of the best works of the author. I confess not
to have discovered many points for admiration.
There are a few good points in it which may be
reproduced! A stranger appears in the fair, a Puritan,
designated Zealot-of-the-land Busy. He is ordered
to be put in the stocks, and says “I do obey thee,
the Lion may roar but he cannot bite. I am glad
to be thus separated from the <i>Heathen</i> of the Land,
and put apart in the Stocks for the holy cause.”
Humphrey Wasp inquires who he is. He replies
“One that rejoiceth in his affliction, and sitteth
here to prophecy the Destruction of <i>Fairs</i>, and
May-games, Wakes, and Whitson-ales, and doth
sigh and groan for the reformation of these abuses.”
Lanthorn Leatherhead recounts some of the “motions”
(plays) in which he had taken part at this
fair. “‘Jerusalem’ was a stately thing, and so was
‘Nineveh,’ and the ‘City of Norwich’ and ‘Sodom
and Gomorrah;’ with the rising o’ the Prentices ...; but
the ‘Gunpowder-plot,’ there was a get-penny!
I have presented that to an eighteen or
twenty-pence audience nine times in an afternoon.
Your home-born projects ever prove the best, they
are so easy and familiar; they put too much learning
in their things now o’ days.” In this spirit
John Littlewit had been adapting a too classical
play to the comprehension of the frequenters of the
fair, “as for the <i>Hellespont</i>, I imagine our Thames<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
here; and their <i>Leander</i> I make a Dyer’s son about
Puddle Wharf; and <i>Hero</i> a wench of the Bankside,
who going over one morning to Old Fish
Street, <i>Leander</i> spies her land at Trig-stairs, and
falls in love with her; now do I introduce <i>Cupid</i>,
having metamorphoz’d himself to a drawer [pot-boy]
and he strikes <i>Hero</i> in love with a pint of
sherry....”</p>

<p><i>The Plague.</i>—1625. The Plague again appeared
in the Kingdom, and Charles I. issued a Proclamation
from his Court at Woodstock, wherein he
recites that there is usually extraordinary resort <i>out
of all parts of the Kingdom</i> of persons to attend this
and Stourbridge Fair; hence there is prohibition
against attending these fairs or any others held
within fifty miles of the City of London.</p>

<p>1630. Another like proclamation in consequence
of Plague—this time being in Cambridge. The
King remembering that there were at hand “three
great Fairs of special note, unto which there is extraordinary
resort from all parts of the Kingdom,”
attendance at Bartholomew, Stourbridge and Our
Lady Fair (Southwark) was prohibited.</p>

<p>1637. Again the Plague, and there was issued:
By the King. A Proclamation for putting off this
next Bartholomew Faire in Smithfield, and our
Lady Faire in Southwarke. Giuen at our Court
at Oatelands, the three and twentieth day of Iuly
in the thirteenth yeare of our Reigne. God save
the King. Imprinted at London by Robert
Barker, Printer to the King’s most excellent Maiestie:
And by the Assigns of Iohn Bill. 1637.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
A sheet in Black Letter. Copy in Mr. Huth’s
Library.</p>

<p><i>New Grant to the City.</i>—1638. Charles I. this
year granted a Charter to London which contained
the following:</p>

<p>We will also, and by these presents for us our
heirs and successors declare and grant that the said
Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens and their
successors for ever may have hold and enjoy all
those fields called or known by the name of —
and also all that field called West-Smithfield in the
Parish of St. Sepulchre’s, St. Bartholomew the
Great, St. Bartholomew the Less in the suburbs of
London, or in some of them, to the uses, intents and
purposes after expressed; and that the same Mayor
and Commonalty and Citizens, and their successors
may be able to hold in the said field called Smithfield,
<i>Fairs</i> and <i>Markets</i> there to be and used to be
held, and to take receive and have pickage, stallage,
tolls and profits appertaining, happening, belonging
or arising out of the fairs and markets there, to
such uses as the same mayor and commonalty and
citizens, or their predecessors had, held or enjoyed,
and now have, hold and enjoy, or ought to have,
hold or enjoy the said premises last mentioned,
and to no other uses, intents and purposes whatsoever.</p>

<p><i>Wrestling Matches.</i>—It had been the time-honoured
custom of this fair to have contests in
wrestling. And during the reign of James I. (apparently)
the Corporation of the City laid down
the following regulation to be observed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
attendance of the Mayor and members of the Corporation
to witness the sport:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">On Bartholomew Day for Wrestling.</span>—So
many Aldermen as dine with my Lord Mayor
and the Sheriffs, be apparelled in their scarlet gowns,
lined, and after dinner their horses be brought to
them where they dine, and those aldermen which
dine with the sheriffs, ride with them to my lord’s
house to accompany him to wrestling. Then when
the wrestling is done, they take their horses, and
ride back again thro’ the Fair, and so in at Aldersgate,
and so home again to the said Lord Mayor’s
house.”</p>

<p>Then there was a regulation for attending the
“Shooting” there, as follows: “The next day, if
it be not Sunday, for the Shooting as upon Bartholomews
day, but if it be Sunday, the Monday
following.”</p>

<p><i>Description of the Fair.</i>—1641. There was published
a Tract (a small quarto of four leaves): “Bartholomew
Faire, or Variety of fancies, where you
may find, a faire of wares and all to please your
mind. With the severall Enormityes and misdemeanours,
which are there seene and acted. London,
printed for Richard Harper at the Bible and Harp
in Smithfield,” wherein the author, after giving a
graphic account of the art of picking pockets
there, proceeds:</p>

<p>It is remarkable and worth your observation, to
behold and hear the strange sights and confused
noises in the fair. Here a knave in a Fool’s coat,
with a trumpet sounding, or on a drum beating,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
invites you and would fain persuade you to see his
puppets; there a Rogue like a Wild Woodman, or
in an antick shape like an incubus, desires your
company to view his motion; on the other side
Hocus Pocus with three yards of tape or ribbon
in ’s hand, showing the art of Legerdemain to the
admiration and astonishment of a company of cockoloaches.
Amongst these you shall see a gray Goose-cap
(as wise as the rest) with a What de ye lack?
in his mouth, standing on his booth shaking a
rattle, or scraping on a fiddle, with which children
are so taken, that they presently cry out for these
fopperies; And all these together make such a distracted
noise, that you would think Babel were not
comparable to it. Here there are also your gamesters
in action; some turning of a whimsey, others
throwing for pewter, who can quickly dissolve a
round shilling into a three halfpenny saucer.</p>

<p>Long Lane at this time looks very fair, and puts
out her best clothes with the wrong side outwards,
so turned for their better turning off; and Cloth
Fair is now in great request: well fare the alehouses
therein; yet better may a man fare (but at a dearer
rate) in the Pig market, alias Pasty nook or Pie
Corner, where pigs are all hours of the day on the
stalls piping hot, and would cry (if they could
speak) Come eat me; but they are ... dear and
the reckonings for them are ... saucy, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is clear that the glory of the fair is departing—Royal
Proclamations notwithstanding.</p>

<p><i>Political Pamphlets.</i>—1647. It seems to have
become the fashion to designate some of the many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
political pamphlets of this period “Bartholomew
Fairings.” One such work appeared this year entitled:
“General Massey’s Bartholomew Fayrings to
Colonel Poyntz.” This was ascribed to the famous
John Lilburne. It was answered in another pamphlet:
“Reformados Righted, being an Answer to a
paltry piece of Poetry entitled, &amp;c.” There is
nothing in either of these throwing any light upon
the fair. The same was not quite the case with a
quarto pamphlet of the following year: “An
Agitator Anatomised.” Here was reference to “a
large and beautiful Camel from Grand Cairo in
Egypt.” Mr. Morley thinks this may have been
the beginning of “wild-beast shows” in the fair.</p>

<p>This year the Act was passed against “Stage
plays.” It seemed destined to have an influence
on the fair.</p>

<p>1648. Evelyn in his “Diary,” under date 28th
August this year, notices his coming to London from
Say’s Court and seeing the “the celebrated follies
of Bartholomew Fair.” The date here seems to
indicate some change in the date of the fair.</p>

<p><i>The Commonwealth and the Fair.</i>—1649. This
was a year of political commotion. The troubles
with the King had terminated on the block. There
was issued in the form of a tract, a book-play entitled:
“A Bartholomew Fairing, New, New,
New; Sent from the raised siege before Dublin, as
a preparatory Present to the Great Thanksgiving
Day. To be communicated onely to Independents.”
It was published without any printer’s name. Its
contents throw some light upon the political events<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
of the period; but these have no bearing upon the
fair, present or future.</p>

<p>It seems indeed to have been anticipated that
the advent of the Puritans into power in this the
first year of the Commonwealth might have led
to the suppression of the fair. The speech of
Zealot-of-the-land Busy, while sitting in the stocks
at the fair in 1614 (“Bartholomew Fair,” by Ben
Jonson) seemed prophetically to hint at this. Mr.
Morley gives the following instructive picture of the
period:</p>

<p>The Puritans did not suppress Bartholomew Fair.
There were indeed no dramas performed in it by
living actors, but the state did not condescend, like
Rabbi Busy, to engage in controversy with the
puppets. It was for the Corporation of London, if
it pleased, to exercise control, and there was a Lord
Mayor, who, as we shall see, did make himself eminent
for an attack upon the wooden Dagons of the Show.
Against the fool in his motley none made war;
Cromwell himself had in his private service four
buffoons, and had he visited the fair, true hero as
he was, might have been well disposed to mount a
hobby-horse. Therefore the clown still jested, and
the toyman thrust his baubles in the face of the
Roundhead, while the Cavalier’s lady, with a constellation
of black stars about her nose, a moon of
ink on her chin, and a coach and horses—a very
fashionable patch—on her forehead, laughed at the
short hair under the broad-brimmed hat of the
offended gentleman. Well might she laugh at the
miserable scarecrow in plain cloak and jerkin, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
in boots that fitted him: for he had no love
locks and no peaked beard like the gallant at her
side; he wore only a little pecked band instead
of a laced collar, and as for his breeches—not only
did they want ornament and width; but they even
showed no elegant bit of shirt protruding over them!
Across the Smithfield pavement, Cavaliers in boots
two inches too long, and with laced tops wide
enough to contain each of them a goose, straddled
about; compelled to straddle in order that the long
and jingling spur of one boot, hooked into the ruffle
of the other, might not bring down the whole man
into the gutter. Women I say might note such
things, but the men were in earnest. The dainty
Cavalier in the historical shirt, embroidered with the
deeds of profane heroes, might glance from the
speckled face of his companion towards the clean
cheeks of the Puritan maid in the religious petticoat
worked over with texts and scripture scenes; all
had their vanities, their froth of weakness floating
loose above the storm; all had an eye for the jest
of the fair, but under it lay in a heaving mass the
solemn earnest of the time. The fair brought together
from almost all parts of England, men who
had urgent thoughts to exchange, harmonies and
conflicts now of principle and now of passion to express.
The destiny of fatherland was hidden from
all in a future black with doubt. Men brave and
honest had their souls pledged in allegiance to an
earthly king, over whom and against whom others
as brave and as honest set up rights given to them
by the King of kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>1650. There was published a broadside and cut,
with a “Description of Bartholomew Fair:”—</p>

<p>1656. During the Commonwealth several attempts
were made by the lord mayors to put some
check on the freedom of this fair.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> One of them,
Sir John Deltrich, was knighted by Cromwell soon
after the fair-time (viz. 5th Sept.) in 1656; and it
has been rightly assumed that he was the mayor
who pressed hard against those puppet showmen and
others who had commenced the business of the fair,
as he conceived, twelve hours too soon, and were
already at work when he arrived to proclaim the
opening. This event appears to have led to a burlesque
opening by a company of tailors who met at
the “Hand and Shears” already noticed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
night before the official opening, elected a chairman,
and as the clock struck twelve, went out into the
Cloth Fair, each with a pair of shears in his hand.
The chairman then proclaimed the fair to the expectant
mob; and then all formed a procession to
proceed in tumultuous array to announce the fair
to the sleepers in Smithfield, by the ringing of bells
and other discordant manifestations. The following
is the form of proclamation used, and contains nothing
objectionable.</p>

<p><i>An unauthorised Proclamation.</i>—O yez! O yez!
O yez! All manner of persons may take notice that
in the Close of St. Bartholomew the Great and West
Smithfield, London, and the streets, lanes and places
adjoining, is now to be held a Fair for this day and
the two days following, to which all people may
freely resort and buy and sell according to the
Liberties and Privileges of the said Fair, and may
depart without disturbance, paying their duties.
And all persons are strictly charged and commanded
in His Majesty’s name, to help the peace, and to do
nothing in the disturbance of the said Fair, as they
will answer the contrary at their peril; and that
there be no manner of arrest or arrests but by such
officers as are appointed. And if any person be
aggrieved, let them repair to the Court of Pie-Powder,
where they will have speedy relief according
to Justice and Equity. God save the King.</p>

<p>This irregular proclamation seems to have been
accepted as a legal act by the Lord Kensington who
had become owner of one-half of the tolls of the
fair, and it continued down to 1839. It was but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
a repetition of the double jurisdiction claimed in
Sturbridge Fair.</p>

<p>There is in the library of the British Museum
a doggrel ballad, printed as a broad-sheet, called
“The Dagonizing of Bartholomew Fair,” which
describes, with coarse humour—the grossness of
which may be attributed in part to the mingled
resentment and contempt which underlies it—the
measures taken by the civil authorities for the
removal from the fair of the showmen who had
pitched there in spite of the determination of the
Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen to suppress
with the utmost rigour everything which could
move to laughter or minister to wonder. Among
these are mentioned a fire-eating conjuror, a “Jack
Pudding,” and “wonders made of wax,” being the
earliest notice of a waxwork exhibition which I
have been able to discover.—<span class="smcap">Frost’s</span> <i>Old Showman</i>,
&amp;c., p. 31.</p>

<p>In “A Caveat for Cut-purses,” a ballad of the
time of Charles I., there is the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Players do tell you, in Bartholomew Faire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What secret consumptions and rascals you are;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For one of their Actors, it seems, had the fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">By some of your trade to be fleeced of late.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another ballad, “Ragged and Torn and
True,” there is this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The pick-pockets in a throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At a market or a faire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will try whose purse is strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That they may the money share.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Restoration.</i>—1661. The Restoration led to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
a considerable reaction from the severities of the
Commonwealth, and the incidents of the fair were
affected thereby, as will be seen. The first noticeable
feature is that the period of the fair becomes
permanently prolonged from three to fourteen days;
with occasional extensions it is said to six weeks’ riot
and amusement. Another that the pamphleteering
continued to be associated with the fair. There
was one “Strange News from Bartholomew Fair”
&amp;c. by Peter Aretine, printed for “Theodosus
Microcosmus.” The contents of this publication are
altogether too gross for detailed mention. There
was another tract “News from Bartholomew Fair.
Or the World’s Mad: being a Description of the
Varieties and Fooleries of this present Age,” with
Allowance (<i>i.e.</i> Licensed) “Printed for the general
use of the Buyer, and perticular Benefit of the
Seller.” It had for motto “Risum teneatis amici?”
and a frontispiece representing a modified Puritan, in
presence of Jacob Hall the fashionable rope-dancer,
exhibiting the varieties of dress!</p>

<p>1663. “Pepys’s Diary,” that never-failing source
of reference, throws some light upon the doings of
the fair at this period. On the 25th Aug. morrow
of St. Bartholomew’s Day (new style), Mr. Pepys
going at noon to the Exchange, met a fine fellow
with trumpets before him in Leadenhall Street,
and upon inquiry found that he was “Clerk of the
City Market:” three or four men attended him
each carrying an arrow of a pound weight in his
hand. This was a revival by the Lord Mayor of the
old City custom of challenging any to shoot at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
fair. The previous day his lordship had attended
to witness the wrestling. On the following there
was to be the civic hunting! But the feeling had
so far changed (perhaps in consequence of the event
of 1656) that the Lord Mayor’s presence was not
desired at this. “The people of the fair cry out
upon it, as a great hindrance to them.”</p>

<p>1664. From the correspondence of the philosopher
John Locke, at this date it is clear he had
elbowed his way with the rest of the world through
the crowd and made a study of this fair. Thus
describing the sights of the city of Cleves (from
whence he writes) to John Strachy at Bristol, he
says “In the principal church at Cleves was a little
altar for the service of Christmas Day. The scene
was a stable, wherein was an ox, an ass, a cradle,
the Virgin, the Babe, Joseph, shepherds, and angels,
dramatis personæ. Had they but given them
motion it had been a perfect Puppet play, and
might have deserved pence a piece; for they were
of the same size and make that our English puppets
are; and I am confident these shepherds and this
Joseph are kin to that Judith and Holophernes
which I had seen at Bartholomew Fair.”</p>

<p><i>Plague.</i>—1665-6. There was no fair in these
years in consequence of the Plague visitation. In
the former of the two years at the usual fair-time bale
fires were burning in the streets night and day to
purify the air, and they continued until quenched
by heavy rain. In the following year there occurred
during the fair-time (as now extended) the Great
Fire of London, flames two miles in extent and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
mile in breadth, with smoke extending fifty miles.
There would have been a scene of intense confusion
if the fair had been gathered; no real danger, perhaps,
as the conflagration ended at Pye Corner, on
the verge of the site of the fair. The houses then
spared here were in existence down to Oct. 1809.</p>

<p>In the following year the fair was resumed, and
probably was of some service to the City in bringing
people and money to it again. Pepys “the immortal”
records under date 28th Aug. “went twice
round Bartholomew Fair, which I was glad to see
again, after two years missing of it by the plague.”
It seems patent that Court people and ladies of all
qualities were at home in the fair at this period.
Pepys records how he took his wife in 1668 “and
there did see a ridiculous obscene little stage play
called ‘Marry Audrey,’ a foolish thing, but seen
by everybody; and so to Jacob Hall’s dancing of
the ropes—a thing worth seeing and mightily followed.”</p>

<p><i>Tolls.</i>—1671. The Corporation of London was
dissatisfied with the profits of the fair accruing from
the arrangement then subsisting, and referred it to
the Comptroller to let the ground for the City and
report the tolls to the first court after the fair.
This was done, and appears to have been satisfactory,
as the Corporation continued to receive the
direct proceeds down to 1685, when the tolls were
leased to the Sword-bearer for three years at a clear
rental of £100 per annum. At the expiration of
two years it was reported that the tolls had not
amounted to more than £68; they were leased to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the Sword-bearer at this rental for twenty-one
years.</p>

<p>1674. In “Poor Robin’s Almanack” for this
year, in a catalogue of jests upon the purposes or
features of fairs, is the following “Aug. 24 Smithfield
for Jack puddings, pigs heads, and Bartholomew
Babies.”</p>

<p>1678. The “Irregularities and Disorders” of
this fair were brought under the notice of the civil
authorities; and the question was referred to a
Committee “to consider how the same might be
prevented, and what damages would occur to the
City by laying down the same.” This is the first
hint of suppression by the City; “and its arising,”
says Mr. Morley, “is <i>almost simultaneous with the
decay of the great annual gathering as a necessary seat
of trade</i>.” He adds, “There is no year in which it
can be distinctly said that then the Cloth Fair died.
Even at this hour, when the fair itself is extinct,
there are in the street called Cloth Fair, on the site
of the old mart, one or two considerable shops of
Cloth-merchants, who seem there to have buried
themselves out of sight, and to be feeding upon the
traditions of the fair.”</p>

<p><i>Cloth Trade.</i>—It is in connection with the woollen
cloth trade that Bartholomew Fair most linked itself
with commerce. It was not simply the great metropolitan
cloth fair, but it was the greatest fair for
woollen cloths held in England. For centuries wool
had been the great staple of this country. Kings
had taken its regulation under their own particular
charge. The highest official in the land took his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
seat amongst the peers of the realm literally on a
sack of wool. Cloth ranked first amongst the products
of the nation’s industry. Among the fairs of
the world English woollen cloth was an important
article of commerce. The centre of this trade for
several centuries was located in this particular fair.
Other fairs had other specialities. But St. Bartholomew’s
was the annual trade gathering of English
clothiers and London drapers. The arms of the
Merchant Tailors were engraved upon a silver yard—thirty-six
inches in length and thirty-six ounces
in weight,—with which century after century members
of their body were deputed to attend at West
Smithfield during the fair, and test the measures of
the clothiers and drapers (See 1609). The “Hand
and Shears” was a famous hostelry within the
Close, where the cloth-merchants and the tailors
fraternized. And here, too, the Court of Piepowder
was long held when removed from the Abbey.</p>

<p>It remains to be stated in connection with the
events of this year that there was a very grave
question involved as to whether the City had any
legal right to suppress the fair. The Cattle Fair was
still very considerable (see 1715).</p>

<p>1682. There was published a new edition of
“Wit and Drollery: Jovial Poems” (1682); there
is contained the following epitome of the features
of the fair (not contained in the edition of
1656):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here’s that will challenge all the fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come buy my nuts and damsons and Burgamy pears!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here’s the Woman of Babylon, the Devil and the Pope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And here’s the little Girl just going on the Rope!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Here are the Bears that dance like any Ladies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tat, tat, tat, tat, says little penny Trumpet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here’s Jacob Hall, that does so jump it, jump it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sound Trumpet, sound, for silver spoon and fork,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, here’s your dainty Pig and Pork.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It had in fact come to this—as Sir Robert Southwell
truly said in a letter to his son in 1685: “The
main importance of this fair is not so much for merchandise,
and the supplying what people really
want; but as a sort of Bacchanalia, to gratify
the multitude in their wandering and irregular
thoughts.”</p>

<p>1688. It had become a custom for the Lord
Mayor after proclaiming the fair to call upon the
keeper of Newgate, whose services were usually involved
during the fair, and partake of “a cool
tankard of wine, nutmeg, and sugar.” This year Sir
John Shorter—natural grandfather of Horace Walpole,
and of his cousins the Conway Seymours—followed
the usual course, but let the lid of the
tankard flop down with so much force that his horse
started; he was thrown to the ground, and died the
next day. The practice was discontinued during
the second mayoralty of Sir Matthew Wood.</p>

<p>In “The Lady’s New Year’s Gift; or, Advice to
a Daughter,” published this year, it is observed:
“Some women are for merry-meetings, as Bessus
was for Duels; they are ingaged in a Circle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
Idleness, where they run round for the whole year,
without the interruption of a serious hour; they
know all the Players names &amp; are Intimately
acquainted with all the Booths in Bartholomew
Fair.”</p>

<p>1690. Literature still continued to be associated
with the fair. Thus there was published this year:
“The City Revels, or the Humours of Bartholomew
Fair,” by J. G. Gent. Sold by Randal Taylor,
near Stationers-Hall, and by most Booksellers.
Price stitcht 6<i>d.</i>—not a single copy of which is now
known to exist. There was also published about
this date “Roger in Amaze: Or the Countrymans
Ramble through Bartholomew Fair. To the tune
of: The Dutch Womans Jigg. Printed by and
for A. M. and sold by J. Walter,” &amp;c. A sheet
containing eight six-line stanzas. (Library of H.
Huth, Esq.)</p>

<p>1691. There was a strong feeling setting in at
this period against the fair. The Corporation ordered
a return to the original term of three days,
not only as a check to vice, but in order that the
pleasures of the fair might not choke up the
avenues of traffic. It is clear that this was not
effective, for the order was repeated three years
later. See 1711.</p>

<p>1697. The Lord Mayor issued an Ordinance
“for the suppression of vicious practices in Bartholomew
fair, as obscene, lascivious and scandalous
plays, comedies, and farces, unlawful games and interludes,
drunkenness, &amp;c., strictly charging all constables
and other officers to use the utmost diligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
in prosecuting the same.” <i>Vide</i> “Postman” of this
date.</p>

<p>Political allusions were very freely made in the
amusements of the Fair; and sometimes these
brought speedy retaliation. Thus, in the present
year William Philips, a Zany or Jack Pudding, was
arrested and publicly whipped for perpetrating in
the fair a jest on the repressive tendencies of the
Government, which the poet Prior has condensed
and preserved for us. The said clown made his
appearance on the exterior stage of the show with a
tongue in his left hand, and a black pudding in his
right. Professing to have learned an important
secret, by which he hoped to profit, he communicated
it to the mountebank, in words recorded by
Prior thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Be of your patron’s mind whate’er he says;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep very much, think little, and talk less:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mind neither good nor bad, nor right nor wrong;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But eat your pudding, slave, and hold your tongue.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This same W. Philips is suspected to have an important
history of his own—indeed, to have been
something besides a clown. He is believed to have
been the author of the “Revengeful Queen,” published
in 1698; also of “Alcamenes and Menelippa,”
and of a farce called “Britons, Strike Home,”
which was acted in a booth in Bartholomew Fair.
Relating to him is also supposed to have been a book
published in 1688, of which nothing but the title-page
is now known to exist. This is preserved in
the Harleian collection, viz., “The Comical History
of the famous Merry Andrew, W. Phill., Giving an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
account of his Pleasant Humours, Various Adventures,
Cheats, Frolicks, and Cunning Designs, both
in City and Country.” A copy of this would now
command a large price.</p>

<p>Another of the great show characters of this
period was Joseph Clark, the “Posturer.” He is
the “whimsical fellow” mentioned by Addison in
the “Guardian,” No. 102. He was the son of a
distiller in Shoe Lane, and was intended for the
medical profession. This did not suit his views, nor
did the trade of a mercer, to which he was next put.
He probably became buffoon in the Court of the
Duke of Buckingham. Finally he appeared in the
Fair. His performance chiefly consisted in the
imitation of every kind of human deformity; and
he is said to have imposed so completely upon
Molins, the famous surgeon, as to be dismissed by
him as an incurable cripple! There is a notice of
him in the “Philosophical Transactions,” where it
is related that he “had such an absolute command
of all his muscles and joints that he could disjoint
almost his whole body.” A portrait in Tempest’s
collection represents him in the act of shouldering
his leg, an antic which is imitated by a monkey.
Frost’s “Old showman,” p. 59.</p>

<p>1698. A Frenchman, Monsieur Sorbière, visiting
London, says: “I was at Bartholomew Fair. It
consists of most Toy Shops, also Fiance, and Picture,
Ribbon Shops, no Books; many shops of Confectioners,
where any woman may commodiously be
treated. Knavery is here in perfection, dexterous
Cut-purses and Pickpockets. I went to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Dancing on the Ropes, which was admirable.
Coming out, I met a man that would have took off
my hat, but I secured it, and was going to draw my
sword, crying out ‘Begar! Damn’d Rogue! Morbleu,’
&amp;c., when on a sudden I heard a hundred
People about me, crying, ‘Here Monsieur, see
“Jephthah’s Rash Vow.”’ ‘Here, Monsieur, see
“The Tall Dutchwoman.”’ ‘See “The Tiger,”’
says another. ‘See “The Horse and No Horse,”
whose tail stands where his head should do.’ ‘See
the “German Artist,” Monsieur.’ ‘See the “Siege
of Namur,” Monsieur;’ so that betwixt Rudeness
and Civility I was forc’d to get into a fiacre, and
with an air of haste and a full trot, got home to my
lodgings.”</p>

<p class="dropcap"><i>Stage Plays and Interludes.</i>—The Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen resolved
that no booths should be permitted
to be erected in Smithfield this
year; but on the 6th August it was announced that
“the lessees of West Smithfield having on Friday
last represented to the Court of Aldermen at Guildhall
that it would be highly injurious to them
to have the erection of all booths there totally
prohibited, the Right Hon. Lord Mayor and the
Court of Aldermen have, in consideration of the
premises, granted licence to erect some booths
during the time of Bartholomew Fair now approaching:
but none are permitted for music-booths, or
any that may be means to promote debauchery.”
And on the 23rd, when the Lord Mayor went on
horseback to proclaim the Fair, he ordered two
music-booths to be taken down immediately.</p>

<p>1701. On the 4th June this year the Grand Jury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
of Middlesex made a presentment to the following
effect:—</p>

<p>“Whereas we have seen a printed order of the
Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen the 25th June
1700, to prevent the great profaneness, vice, and
debauchery, so frequently used and practised in
Bartholomew Fair, by strictly charging and commanding
all persons concerned in the said fair, and
in the sheds and booths to be erected and built
therein or places adjacent, that they do not let, sell,
or hire, or use any booth, shed, stall, or other erection
whatsoever to be used or employed for interludes,
stage-plays, comedies, gaming-places, lotteries,
or music meetings: and as we are informed the
present Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen have
passed another order to the same effect on the 3rd
instant; we take this occasion to return our most
hearty thanks for their religious care and great zeal
in this matter; we esteeming a renewal of their
former practices at the Fair a continuing one of the
chiefest miseries of vice next to the Play-Houses;
therefore earnestly desire that the said orders may
be vigorously prosecuted, and that this honourable
Court would endeavor that the said fair may be employed
to those good ends and purposes it was at first
designed.”</p>

<p>In the “Postman,” of September, appeared the
following advertisement: “The tiger in Bartholomew
Fair, that yesterday gave such satisfaction
to persons of all qualities by pulling the feathers so
nicely from live fowls, will, at the request of several
persons, do the same thing this day; price, 6<i>d.</i> each.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>There was published this year for R. Hine near
the Royal Exchange, “A Walk to Smithfield, or
a True Description of the Humours of Bartholomew
Fair, with the very comical Intrigues and
Frolics that are acted in every particular Booth in
the Fair, by persons of all ages and sexes, from the
Court Gallant to the Country Clown. With the
Old Droll-Players’ Lamentation for the loss of
their Yearly Revenues: being very Pleasing and
Diverting.”</p>

<p>It seems that at this period the principal London
theatres closed during the fair. This was so with
Drury Lane in 1702; and also with several of the
theatres during May Fair. See 1714.</p>

<p>1703. In the “Observator” of August 21 this
year was the following:</p>

<p>Does this market of lewdness tend to anything
else but the ruin of the bodies, and souls and estates,
of the young men and women of the City of London,
who here meet with all the temptations to destruction?
The Lotteries, to ruin their estates; the
drolls, comedies, interludes, and farces to poison
their minds, &amp;c.; and in the cloisters what strange
medley of lewdness has not that place long since
afforded? Lords and ladies, aldermen and their
wives, ’squires and fiddlers, citizens and rope-dancers,
jack-puddings and lawyers, mistresses and
maids, masters and ’prentices! This is not an ark,
like Noah’s which received the clean and the unclean;
only the unclean beasts enter this ark, and
such as have the devil’s livery on their backs!</p>

<p>1707. This year a well-known theatrical manageress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
Mrs. Mynn, produced a new version of the
“Siege of Troy,” reduced from five to three acts,
by the aged actor, Settle. The piece was printed
with the following introduction:—</p>

<p><i>A Printed Publication of an <span class="antiqua">Entertainment</span> performed
on a <span class="antiqua">Smithfield stage</span>, which, how gay or
richly soever set off, will hardly reach to a higher
<span class="antiqua">Title</span> than the customary name of a <span class="smcap">Droll</span>, may seem
somewhat new. But as the present undertaking, the
work of ten Months’ preparation, is so extraordinary
a performance, that without Boast or Vanity we may
modestly say, <span class="antiqua">In</span> the whole <span class="antiqua">several Scenes, Movements</span>,
and <span class="antiqua">Machines, it is noways</span> Inferiour even to
any one <span class="antiqua">Opera</span> yet seen in either of the <span class="antiqua">Royal Theatres</span>;
we are therefore under some sort of necessity to make
this Publication, thereby to give ev’n the meanest of
our audience a full Light into all the Object they will
there meet in this <span class="antiqua">expensive Entertainment</span>; the <span class="antiqua">proprietors</span>
of which have adventur’d to make, under
small Hopes, That as they yearly see some of their
happier Bretheren Undertakers in the <span class="smcap">Fair</span>, more
cheaply obtain even the Engrost Smiles of the Gentry
<span class="antiqua">and</span> Quality at so much an easier Price; so on the other
side their own more costly Projection (though less
Favourites) might possibly attain to that good Fortune,
at least to attract a little share of the good graces of the
more Honourable part of the Audience, and perhaps be
able to purchase some of those smiles which elsewhere
have been thus long the profuser Donation of particular
Affection of Favour.</i></p>

<p><i>Limiting the Duration of the Fair.</i>—1708. On
the 2nd June this year the Court of Common
Council passed the following resolution:—</p>

<p>This Court taking notice that the Fair of St.
Bartholomew according to the original Grant thereof,
ought to be holden annually three days and no
longer. And that by Continuing the said Fair to
Fourteen days, as of late hath been practised, and
the erecting and setting up Booths in Smithfield of
extraordinary largeness not occupied by dealers in
Goods, merchandises, &amp;c., proper for a fair; but
used chiefly for Stage-plays, Musick and Tipling
(being so many receptacles of vicious and disorderly
Persons) Lewdness and Debauchery have apparently
increased, Tumults and Disorders frequently arisen,
and the Traffick of the said Fair, by the Traders
and Fair-keepers resorting thereto, greatly interrupted
and diminished. After long debate, and
serious consideration had of the same, and being desirous
to put a Stop (so far as in them lies) to the
further spreading of Wickedness and Vice, to preserve
the Peace of Her Majesty’s Subjects, and
restore the said Fair to its primitive Institution, and
the Traders resorting thither to the full enjoyment
of their Trades, without any hindrance or obstruction.
And this Court being of opinion, that no ways
will be so effectual for the end aforesaid as reducing
the said Fair to its ancient time of continuance,
doth unanimously resolve, and so Order that for the
future, the said Fair shall be kept Three days only,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
and no longer (that is to say) on the Eve of St.
Bartholomew, that Day and the Morrow after being
the 23rd, 24th and 25 days of August, of which all
persons concerned are to take Notice and Govern
themselves accordingly. See 1750.</p>

<p>On the 3rd July, same year, the Common Council
considered certain strong petitions for the revocation
of this Order. The result is seen in the following
announcement, which appeared in the “Gazette”
of 2nd August:—</p>

<p>The Committee for letting the City’s Land in the
Account of the Chamberlain of the City of London
give notice, That the Fair, commonly call’d Bartholomew
Fair, annually held in West Smithfield in
London is from henceforth to be held three Days
and no longer [days specified] and that the said
Committee will sit every Wednesday at three of the
Clock in the afternoon, to Lett and Dispose of the
Ground in West Smithfield, to persons resorting to
the said Fair; of which more particular information
may be had at the Comptroler’s Office in the Guildhall
of the said City.</p>

<p>Same year a person did penance in the Chapter
House of St. Paul’s for publicly showing in the Fair
a Blow-Book in which were many filthy and obscene
pictures. The book was likewise burned, and the
offender paid the costs.</p>

<p>The first travelling <i>menagerie</i> seems now to have
appeared in this fair, and attracted considerable attention.
It stood near the hospital gate. “Sir Hans
Sloane cannot be supposed to have missed such an
opportunity of studying animals little known, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
is said to have constantly visited the fair for that
purpose, and to have retained the services of a
draughtsman for their representation.” (Frost.)</p>

<p>It may be noted that wild beasts had been kept
at the Tower certainly from 1253 downwards.</p>

<p>1709. There was published “Bart’lemy Fair:
or an Enquiry after Wit; in which due Respect is
had to a Letter concerning Enthusiasm, To my
Lord —. By Mr. Wotton. London Printed
for R. Wilkin, at the King’s Head in St. Paul’s
Church-Yard.” This 8vo. pamphlet of 175 pages
contains no reference to the fair, and probably only
took its title from reference to the disputations there
conducted, and of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>1710. There was a curious half-sheet octavo
tract, printed this year, entitled “The Wonders
of England, containing Dogget and Penkethman’s
Dialogue with Old Nick, on the suppression of
Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield.” The title enumerates
several other strange and wonderful matters,
as being contained in the book, but, like the showman’s
painted cloths in the fair, pictures monsters
not visible within; so there is not a line in the tract
respecting the suppression of the fair. Yet</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Coming events cast their shadows before.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>1711. It seems probable that in 1691, or 1694,
when the Corporation took steps to limit the period
of the fair, that a printed statement of the reasons
therefor was issued for the edification of the public
mind. At all events during the present year there
appeared: “Reasons Formerly published for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Punctual Limiting of Bartholomew Fair to those
Three Days to which it is determined by the
Royal Grant of it to the City of London. New
reprinted with Additions, to prevent a Design set
on Foot to procure an Establishment of the said
Fair for Fourteen Days. Humbly Addressed to
the present Right Honorable the Lord Mayor to
the Worshipful Court of Aldermen, and to the
Common Council of the said City. London Printed
in the year 1711.”</p>

<p>1714. It had become the custom for the stars of
Drury Lane, Covent Garden, the Haymarket, Lincoln’s
Fields, and Goodman’s Fields theatres to
enter into engagements to act in the theatrical
booths in Smithfield, and probably also in Southwark;
and a rich “benefit” they made, sometimes
by acting, but more generally by becoming partners
in a company organized for the purposes of the
fair. Recruits were brought up from the provincial
theatres, and thus became familiar to London
audiences.</p>

<p>1715. In “Dawk’s News Letter” it is recorded,
“On Wednesday Bartholomew Fair began,
to which we hear the greatest number of black
cattle (Welsh?) was brought that was ever known.”
There was this year at the fair the largest booth
ever built—it was for the King’s players! It had
become the custom to represent all the great sieges
in which England had been concerned at the shows
in the fair: hence, perhaps, something was done
towards fostering a martial spirit, not without its
advantages in a national sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>1719. The restriction of the fair to three days,
we are informed, had long been overruled by the
public voice. There were this year twenty licensed
dice and hazard tables in the fair.</p>

<p>1730. There was printed in the “Daily Post”
for the 31st August the following:—</p>

<p>“These are to give notice to all Ladies, Gentlemen
and others That, at the end of Hosier Lane in
Smithfield are to be seen during the time of the
Fair, Two <i>Rattle Snakes</i>, one a very large size, and
rattles that you may hear him at a quarter of a mile
about, and something of Musick, that grows on the
tails thereof; of divers colours, forms and shapes,
with darts that they extend out of their mouths,
almost two inches long. They were taken on the
mountains of Leamea. A Fine Creature, of a
small size, taken in Mocha, that burrows under
ground. It is of divers colours, and very beautiful.
The teeth of a dead Rattle Snake to be seen and
handled, with the rattles. A Sea Snail, taken on
the coast of India. Also the horn of a Flying Buck.
Together with a curious collection of Animals and
of Insects from all parts of the World. To be seen
without Loss of time.”</p>

<p>This seems to have been a very rude attempt at
teaching natural history.</p>

<p>1731. The only recorded instance of <i>fire</i> breaking
out in the fair occurred this year. The damage
resulting was small. (See 1810.)</p>

<p>1733. It was about this date that Fielding the
novelist commenced public life, by keeping a play-booth
in this fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p><i>The Strolling Player.</i>—The life of a strolling play-manager,
attending fairs and such like places of
amusement, was one of much incident, and certainly
had its comical side. Here is the account of one
as given by himself:—“I will, as we say, take you
behind the scenes. First then, a valuable actor
must sleep in the pit, and wake early to sweep the
theatre, and throw fresh sawdust into the boxes; he
must shake out the dresses, and wind up and dust
the motion-jacks; he must teach the dull ones how
to act, rout up the idlers from the straw, and redeem
those that happen to get into the watch-house.
Then, sir, when the fair begins, he should sometimes
walk about the stage grandly and show his
dress: sometimes he should dance with his fellows;
sometimes he should sing; sometimes he should
blow the trumpet; sometimes he should laugh and
joke with the crowd, and give them a kind of
touch-and-go speech, which keeps them merry and
makes them come in. Then, sir, he should sometimes
cover his state robe with a great coat, and go
into the crowd, and shout opposite his own booth,
like a stranger who is struck with its magnificence:
by the way, sir, that is a good trick, I never knew
it fail to make an audience; and then he has only
to steal away and mount his stage and strut, and
dance and sing and trumpet, and roar over again.”—“Every-Day Book,”
i. 1243.</p>

<p>1735. The practice had been to grant licences for
the fair for fourteen days. The Court of Aldermen
now resolved: That Bartholomew Fair shall
not exceed Bartholomew Eve, Bartholomew Day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
and the next morrow, and shall be restricted to the
sale of goods, wares, and merchandises, usually sold
in fairs, <i>and no acting shall be permitted therein</i>. It
was known, too, that sir John Barnard intended
rigorously to enforce the Licensing Act. There was
in consequence no theatrical booths, and hence the
most harmless portion of the amusement was absent.</p>

<p>1736. Theatrical booths were permitted again
this year.</p>

<p>1739. The fair was extended to four days, and
more theatrical booths attended in consequence.</p>

<p>In the “Farrago; or, Miscellanies in Verse and
Prose” [by Richard Barton?], there is included
(pp. 49-58) a piece entitled “Bartholomew Fair,”
from which we take the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Round ev’ry booth in face of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Actors a tawdry dress display;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their ugly visors seem disgrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet often hide an uglier face.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun their sports not to delay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes haste to bed, and closes day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each wooden house then groans, to bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The populace that crowd the fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Wapping &amp; St. James’ unite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pleas’d with coarse objects of delight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chambermaid and countess sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike admirers of the wit:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Earl and footman <i>tête-a-tête</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sit down contented on one seat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The musick plays, the curtain draws,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The peer &amp; ’prentice clap applause.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>1740. The Prince of Wales visited the fair—not,
indeed, for the first time, but with more state than
on any previous occasion. An account of the visit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
was published some years afterwards in the “New
European Magazine,” from which the following
details are drawn:—</p>

<p>The shows were all in full blast and the crowd at
its thickest, when the multitude behind was impelled
violently forward; a broad blaze of red light
issued from a score of flambeaux, streamed into the
air; several voices were loudly shouting, “Room
there for Prince George! Make way for the
Prince!” as there was that long sweep heard to
pass over the ground which indicates the approach
of a grand and ceremonious train. Presently the
pressure became much greater, the voices louder,
the light stronger, and as the train came onward, it
might be seen that it consisted, first, of a party of
the yeomen of the guard, clearing the way; then
several more of them bearing flambeaux, and flanking
the procession; while in the midst of it appeared
a tall, fair, and handsome young man, having something
of a plump foreign visage, seemingly about
four-and-thirty, dressed in a ruby-coloured frock-coat,
very richly guarded with gold lace, and having
his long flowing hair curiously curled over his forehead
and at the sides, and finished with a very large
bag and courtly <i>queue</i> behind. The air of dignity
with which he walked; the blue ribbon and star and
garter with which he was decorated; the small three-cornered
silk hat which he wore, whilst all around
him were uncovered; the numerous suite, as well
of gentlemen as of guards, which marshalled him
along; the obsequious attention of a short, stout
person, who, by his flourishing manner, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
be a player—all these particulars indicated that the
amiable Frederick, Prince of Wales, was visiting
Bartholomew Fair by torchlight, and that Manager
Rich was introducing his royal guest to all the entertainments
of the place.</p>

<p>This event gave fashion to the fair, and, indeed,
it had never been considered derogatory for persons
in the first rank and fashion to partake in the broad
humour and theatrical amusements of the place.
We have already seen that many of the theatrical
celebrities of the day “starred” in Smithfield, and
many who afterwards became famous first trod the
boards here.</p>

<p>The theatrical licences were extended to three
weeks and a month at this fair.</p>

<p>1750. Alderman Blackford being mayor, he proclaimed
in the middle of July his determination to
reduce the fair to its original three days, and to use
the powers of the Licensing Act (10 Geo. II.) for
the more effectual punishment of rogues and vagabonds.
He herein acted upon the representation of
more than a hundred of the chief graziers, salesmen,
and inhabitants of Smithfield, who complained
that the “insolent violation of the law”
by the fair people not only encouraged profligacy,
but also obstructed business for six weeks! The
time occupied in putting up and taking down the
booths being a time also of great hindrance to the
usual Smithfield marketing and trading. The real
suppression of the fair as a fourteen day riot, dates
from this time.</p>

<p>1751. The attempted strict limitation of the fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
to three days led to considerable disturbances.
Birch, a deputy marshal of the city, received injuries
which proved fatal.</p>

<p>1752. The alteration of the calendar transferred
the 3rd September into the 14th. Old Bartholomew’s
Day stood at this new date on the calendar.
This event very much aided in shortening the period
of the fair. <i>Vide</i> “Morley,” p. 449.</p>

<p>1753. There was a great demonstration against
the claim of the Corporation to levy tolls upon the
goods of citizens, as well as upon those of strangers,
during the time of the fair. Richard Holland, a
leather-seller in Newgate Street, had in the preceding
year refused the toll demanded on a roll of
leather with which he had attempted to enter the
fair, and on the leather being seized by the collector,
had called a constable, and charged the impounder
with theft. The squabble resulted in an action
against the Corporation, which was not tried, however,
until 1754, when the result was in favour of
the citizens, and against the Corporation claims.</p>

<p>While the action was pending Holland’s cart
was driven through the fair with a load of hay,
and was not stopped by the collector of tolls. The
horses’ heads were decorated with ribbons, and
on the leaders forehead was a card, upon which
the following doggerel lines were written in a bold
hand:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My master keeps me well, ’tis true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And justly pays whatever is due;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now plainly, not to mince the matter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No toll he pays but with a halter.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">On each side of the load of hay hung a halter, and
a paper bearing the following announcement:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The time is approaching, if not already come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That all British subjects may freely pass on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And not on pretence of Bartholomew Fair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make you pay for your passage, with all your bring near.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When once it is try’d, ever after depend on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twill incur the same fate as on Finchley Common.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give Cæsar his due, when by law ’tis demanded,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And those that deserve with this halter be hanged.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was considerable rioting in the fair. Buck,
the successor to the unfortunate Birch, was very
roughly handled. The tumult was in some degree
allayed by a serious accident to the wire-walker,
Evans. The wire broke, and he was precipitated
to the ground, one of his thighs being broken, and
other injuries sustained.</p>

<p><i>The Bridewell Boys.</i>—1755. An element in the
occasional disturbances at the fair was the conduct
of the “Bridewell Boys,” a body of youths from
the Bridewell Hospital, distinguished by a peculiar
dress and turbulence of manners. They infested
the streets and public places to the terror of the
peaceable; and being allowed the privilege of going
to fires with the Bridewell engine, not unfrequently
occasioned more mischief by their audacity and
perverseness than by their dexterity in fire extinguishment,
resembling in some degree the volunteer
Fire brigades which at one time were very prevalent
in the United States. On the 13th November this
year, at a Court of the Governors of the Hospital, a
memorable report was made by the Committee, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
inquired into the behaviour of the boys at the then
preceding Bartholomew and Southwark fairs; and,
as a consequence, some of them were severely
corrected and cautioned, and others, after their
punishment, were ordered to be stripped of their
hospital clothing and discharged. At a later period
the boys were deprived of their distinguishing
costume, and a different plan of instruction was
adopted.</p>

<p>1760. The Court of Common Council made a
more determined effort than heretofore to put
down this fair; but the interest of Lord Kensington
(successor of Lord Rich) in a portion of the tolls,
rendered it impossible of accomplishment. See 1827.</p>

<p>1762. Plays were interdicted at the fair this
year by the Corporation, and some hardship resulted
to those who had made arrangements in advance.
Strong and successful measures were taken to prevent
its extension beyond the authorized three
days.</p>

<p>There was published “A Description of Bartholomew
Fair” by George Alexander Stevens,
whereof the following gives a good idea of the
medley life there seen:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here was, first of all, crowds against other crowds driving,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like wind and tide meeting, each contrary striving;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrill fiddling, sharp fighting, and shouting and shrieking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fifes, trumpets, drums, bagpipes and barrow girls squeaking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come my rare round and found, here’s choice of fine ware-o;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though all was not found sold at Bartholomew fair-o.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There was drolls, hornpipe dancing, and showing of postures,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With frying black-puddings, and op’ning of oysters;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With Salt-boxes solos, and gallery-folks squalling;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tap house guests roaring, and mouthpieces bawling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pimps, Pawnbrokers, strollers, fat landladies, sailors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bawds, bailiffs, jilts, jockies, thieves, tumblers and taylors.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here’s Punch’s whole play of the Gunpowder-plot, sir,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With “beasts all alive,” and “pease-porridge all hot,” sir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fine sausages fried” and “the Black on the wire,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“The whole Court of France” and “nice pig at the fire.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here’s the up-and-downs, “who’ll take a seat in the Chair-o?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tho’ there’s more up-and-downs than at Bartholomew fair-o.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“The chaise without horses,” and “Queen of Hungary;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here’s the Merry-go-Rounds, “Come who rides, come who rides, sir?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wine, beer, ale, and cakes, fire eating besides, sir;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fam’d “learn’d Dog” that can tell all his letters</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And some men, as scholars, are not much his betters!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>1798. There was a serious proposal made to restrict
the fair to one day. This was only abandoned
from the fear of riot.</p>

<p>1804. There was an action brought in the fair
before the Court of Piepowder on 5th September—showing
that the court had sat beyond the prescribed
three days, which at one time it did not, even though
the fair continued longer—by a fire-eater against
one of the spectators of his tricks, who had half
suffocated him by suddenly clapping a bundle of
lighted matches under his nose. The defendant
was fined a guinea by the homage, and the steward
gave charge to the constables to turn him out of
the fair if he appeared in it again.</p>

<p>1808. There appeared: “The History and
Origin of Bartholomew Fair,” published by Arliss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and Huntsman, 37, Bartholomew Close (8vo. pp.
26).</p>

<p>1810. A circumstance occurred likely to have
been attended with very serious consequences. Two
bands of roughs, who were racing through the fair
after their manner, met. In the scuffle that ensued
two stalls were knocked down, and the falling of a
lamp on to a stove caused the canvas to ignite, and
a serious disaster was only averted by the presence
of mind of a gentleman who was on the spot at the
moment. In a similar rush in 1812 a child was
killed.</p>

<p>In the “Morning Chronicle” appeared the following
“Elegy, written in Bartlemy Fair at Five
o’clock in the morning,” from which I take the
principal stanzas:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>1825. Bartholomew Day falling on a Sunday the
fair was wholly suspended. Many thousands of
persons walking for recreation repaired to Smithfield
and viewed its appearance. The City officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
most strictly enforced observance of the day: one
keeper of a gingerbread stall who plied for custom
and refractorily persisted was taken into custody,
and held in prison till he could be carried before a
magistrate on the following day, when he was fined
for the offence.—Hone.</p>

<p><i>Hone’s survey of the Fair.</i>—It was on the morning
following this day that Hone made his memorable
visit to the fair, which he has recorded at
large in his “Every Day Book” (i. cols. 1168-1251),
and from which I take the following condensed
description of the extent and nature of the
exhibition:—</p>

<p>There were small <i>uncovered</i> stalls from the Skinner
Street corner of Giltspur Street beginning with the
beginning of the churchyard, along the whole length
of the churchyard. On the opposite side there were
like stalls from Newgate Street corner. At these
stalls were sold oysters, fruit, inferior kinds of cheap
toys, common gingerbread, small wicker baskets,
and other articles of trifling value. They seemed
to be mere casual standings taken up by petty dealers
and chapmen in smallware, who lacked means to
purchase room and furnish out a tempting display.
Their stalls were set out from the channel into the
roadway. One man occupied upwards of twenty
feet of the road lengthwise with discontinued wood-cut
pamphlets, formerly published weekly at two
pence, which he spread out on the ground and sold
at a halfpenny each in great quantities; he had also
large folio bible prints at a halfpenny each, and
prints from magazines at four a penny. The fronts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
of these standings were towards the passengers in the
carriage way.</p>

<p>Then with occasional distances of three or four
feet for footways from the road to the pavement
began lines of <i>covered</i> stalls, with their open fronts
opposite the fronts of the houses, and close to the
curb-stone, and their enclosed backs to the road. On
the St. Sepulchre’s side they extended to Cock Lane,
and from thence to Hosier-lane, and along the west
side of Smithfield to the Cow-lane corner. In John
Street they were resumed and ran thitherward to
Smithfield bars, and there on the west side ended.
Crossing over to the east side, and returning south,
these covered stalls commenced opposite their termination
on the west and ran towards Smithfield,
turning into which they ran westerly towards the
pig-market, and from thence to Long-lane. Again
on to the east side to the great gate of Cloth Fair,
and so from Duke Street on the south side to the
great front gate of Bartholomew hospital; and then
resumed to Giltspur Street and so reached the
uncovered stalls.</p>

<p>These covered stalls thus surrounding Smithfield,
belonged to dealers in gingerbread, toys, hardware,
garters, pocket books, trinkets, and articles of all
prices, from a halfpenny to a half sovereign. The
gingerbread stalls varied in size, and were conspicuously
fine from the Dutch gold on their different
shaped ware. The usual frontage of the
stalls was 8, 10, 12 feet, but some as large as 25
feet. They were 6 feet 6 inches or 7 feet high in
front and from 4 feet 6 to 5 feet at back: and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
formed of canvass tightly stretched on light poles.
The fronts were to the pavements. The houses of
business in the streets had their shutters up, and
doors closed.</p>

<p>The <i>Shows</i> of all kinds had their fronts towards
the area of Smithfield, and their backs close against
the backs of the stalls. The centre of the area was
thus entirely open, and from the carriage way
through it all the shows might be seen at one view.
Against the pens at the side there were not any
shows. No carriages or horsemen were permitted
to enter the fair on account of the crowded masses
of people present....</p>

<p>It has to be noted that there was an unusually
large assemblage of shows at the fair, including
several menageries.</p>

<p>1826. The “Mirror of the Months” contained
the following graphic anticipation of the fair to be
held this year:—</p>

<p>Another year arrives, and spite of Corporation
“resolutions,” and references to “the Committee,”
and “Reports” and “recommendations” to abolish
the fair, it is held again. Now arrives that saturnalia
of nondescript noise and nonconformity “Bartlemy
Fair;” when that prince of peace-officers the
Lord Mayor changes his sword of state into a six-penny
trumpet, and becomes the lord of misrule and
the patron of pick-pockets; and lady Holland’s
name leads an unlettered mob instead of a lettered
one; when Richardson maintains, during three
whole days and a half, a managerial supremacy that
must be not a little enviable even in the eyes of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Elliston himself; and Mr. Gyngell holds, during
the same period, a scarcely less distinguished station
as the Apollo of maid servants; when the incomparable
(not to say <i>eternal</i>) <i>young</i> Master Saunder’s
rides on horseback to the admiration of all beholders,
in the person of his eldest son; and when all the
giants in the land, and the dwarfs too, make a
general muster, and each proves to be according to
the most correct measurement at least a foot taller,
or shorter, than any other in the fair, and in fact
the only one worth seeing,—“all the rest being impostors!”
In short, when every booth in the fair
combined in itself the attractions of all the rest, and
so perplexes with its irresistible merit the rapt
imagination of the half-holiday school boys who
have got but sixpence to spend upon the whole,
that they eye the outsides of each in a state of pleasing
despair, till their leave of absence is expired
twice over, and then return home filled with visions
of giants and gingerbread nuts, and dream all night
long of what they have not seen.</p>

<p>The fair was small, and one of its principal
features was the bookstalls, which occupied the
whole of the west side of Giltspur Street.</p>

<p>1827. The fair was again large, and for the first
time I am enabled to present a return of the cash
returns of the various places of amusement there
assembled. The result will be startling to those who
have hitherto failed to realize the importance with
which the fair was regarded: Wombwell’s menagerie,
£1,700; Richardson’s theatre, £1,200; Atkins’s
menagerie, £1,000; Morgan’s menagerie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
£150; exhibition of “pig-faced lady,” £150; ditto,
fat boy and girl, £140; ditto, head of William
Corder, quaker, who was hanged at Chelmsford for
murder of Maria Martin—the crime being revealed
through a dream of the victim’s mother, £100;
Ballard’s menagerie, £90; Ball’s theatre, £80;
diorama of the battle of Navarino, £60; the Chinese
jugglers, £50; Pike’s theatre, £40; a fire-eater,
£30; Frazer’s theatre, £26; Keyes and Line’s
theatre, £20; exhibition of a Scotch giant, £20.
The comparative attractiveness of the different sights
affords room for reflection. Of course these entertainments
only represent a portion of the cash transactions
of the fair.</p>

<p>Lord Kensington at length intimated that considering
the corrupt state of the fair, and the
nuisance caused by it in the neighbourhood of
Smithfield, he would now throw no obstacle in the
way of its abolition. His share of the tolls was
from £30 to £40 a year; the estimated value of
these was from £500 to £600. The Corporation
accordingly bought up these tolls, and henceforward
the sole rights and interest in the fair became vested
in the City.</p>

<p><i>The End.</i>—1839. The London City Mission,
having pointed out to the Corporation the moral
pollution spread by the retention of the fair, the
matter was again referred to the City Lands Committee,
who referred the question to Mr. Charles
Pearson the then able City Solicitor; and he speedily
discovered a rational mode of dealing with it: he
advised <i>an absolute refusal to let standings for show-booths<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
in a fair that was created in the first instance
for the purposes of trade!</i></p>

<p>The Markets Committee had in the meanwhile
been working in the direction of largely increasing
the tolls for stalls, &amp;c. The effect being that in
1836 they had increased to £162, 1838 to £284;
this year £305. The smaller the number of booths
the more each seemed able to pay, showing that
the popular patronage of the fair was still considerable.</p>

<p><i>New Bartholomew Fair.</i>—In 1843 the City
authorities prohibited the assembling of “shows”
of any and all kinds in Smithfield; but with this
prohibition was the announcement that arrangements
had been made for the standing of such shows
as desired on a large piece of ground adjoining the
New North Road, called Britannia Fields, near the
site of the Britannia Theatre, in the parish of
Hoxton.</p>

<p>In this step it may have been thought to preserve
the income from tolls by a bodily transfer of the
fair to another locality. I doubt if the original
Charter would have supported such a course; but
the influence of the City would have obtained the
authority of Parliament for the change. But even
Parliament cannot change the sentiments of the
people in regard to their amusements, or divert the
channels of commerce from the time-honoured
channels in which they have been wont to flow; and
the project for the new Bartholomew Fair fell dead
very early in its inception; but for two or three
years shows did congregate there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>1855. <i>The end had come!</i> The old ceremony of
state proclamation had been discontinued in 1840.
In 1850 the Lord Mayor (Musgrove) having walked
quietly to the appointed gateway with the necessary
attendants, found there was no fair to proclaim!
After that year the Lord Mayor attended no more
for the purpose. The last Bartholomew Fair was
proclaimed this year (1855). The City indeed
still pays to the Rector of Bartholomew the Great
the annual fee of 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in respect of the proclamation
no longer made. The live Cattle Market
was discontinued the same year—removed to Islington.
The Meat Market opened in 1868 has
obliterated all traces of a state of things which had
continued for seven centuries.</p>

<p>1859. Mr. Henry Morley published “Memoirs
of Bartholomew Fair,” “inscribed with friendship
to his friend John Forster.” In his preface he says
“When I first resolved upon the writing these
memoirs, I knew simply that Bartholomew fair was
an unwritten portion of the story of the people.
Bound once to the life of the nation by the three
ties of Religion, Trade and Pleasure, first came a
time when the tie of Religion was unloosened from
it; then it was a place of Trade and Pleasure. A
few more generations having lived and worked,
Trade was no longer bound to it. The nation still
grew, and at last broke from it even as a pleasure
fair. <i>It lived for seven centuries</i> or more, and of its
death we are the witnesses. Surely, methought,
there is a story here; the memoirs of a Fair do not
mean only a bundle of handbills or a catalogue of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
monsters. And then the volume was planned which
is now offered to the reader, with a lively sense of
its shortcomings.” Thus launched upon the world
it was and is a book suited to the companionship of
all lovers of objects of antiquity. I am glad to
have been able to supplement its record with some
details of interest.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is to France that we must look if we
would fully comprehend alike the
splendour and importance of the fairs
of Europe. Even here, as elsewhere,
they are now to be regarded as things of the past;
but of a past that is full of instruction.</p>

<p>In the eighth and ninth centuries hardly any
trade was known in France, other than that carried
on in markets and fairs; these were, therefore,
almost the only places for providing oneself with
necessaries. Artificers and dealers lived apart,
dispersed in the country; the towns were chiefly
inhabited by the clergy and some handicraftsmen,
with few or no monks or nuns, the far greater part
of the monasteries being either in the open country
or the neighbourhood of the cities. The nobility
lived on their estates, or attended the Court. The
<i>Pote</i> people were so far under their Lord’s power
as not to quit the place of their birth without his
leave; the villain was annexed to the estate, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
the slave to the master’s house or land. Such a dispersion
was little promotive of trade, which loves
large and policed communities; <i>and it was to
remedy this inconvenience that its Kings established
so many fairs</i>. <i>Vide</i> “Extracts translated from New
Hist. of France,” 1769, i. 65.</p>

<p>There seem to have been three grades of fairs.—1.
<i>Free fairs</i>, to which all might come without
restriction of toll or other limitation. 2. Fairs
having their franchises restricted by some local right
or usage. 3. Common fairs, without any special
franchises whatever. I shall mainly confine myself
to a notice of those falling under the first of these
definitions—free fairs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Champagne and Brie.</span></h3>

<p>I may speak of the fairs of these provinces collectively.
They were not only amongst the most
celebrated of France or of Europe, but possess the
charm of great antiquity. They are believed to
have been founded by the earls of those provinces.
Sidonius Apollinaris alludes to them, in the fifth century.
They were held in seventeen of the chief cities—some
of which had as many as six yearly, others
four, none less than two.</p>

<p>I have already given (in the first chapter in this
book) some account of the commercial importance
of these fairs in Europe, and need not re-traverse
that ground. They have a great interest from an
English point of view for reasons which will presently
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>These districts were not indeed provinces of
France at the early date above named. They only
became so in 1284, and so far from their fairs gaining
any additional lustre by the annexation, the very
reverse appears to have been the fact. The domination
of the crown of France spread awe instead
of confidence into the minds of their wealthy
traders!</p>

<p>The truth I suspect to be that charges and restrictions
previously unknown were imposed. This
view indeed finds direct support in the fact that in
1349 Philip de Valois granted letters patent confirming
ancient franchises, and suppressing the new
impositions. By means of this document we learn
precisely what the ancient privileges were. The
patent consisted of thirty-six articles, but the more
material may be grouped under five heads, viz.:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Franchises.</i>—All foreign dealers their
factors and agents to have free liberty under the
Royal protection, to resort to these fairs with their
goods, provided however that these same goods
were designed to be sold or exchanged there; or failing
this were to be removed within the appointed
time for the duration of the fair. They were
exempted from all dues, impositions, &amp;c., according
to the good and ancient usages, customs, and liberties
of the said fairs. No favours or letters of respite
might be granted against the said dealers, or
the customs and liberties of the said fairs—all such,
if obtained, being null. No dealers resorting to or
returning from, should be stopped or molested,
without special warrant from the wardens of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
conservation, and for obligations made truly and
really in the fair.</p>

<p>2. <i>Wardens of the Privileges.</i>—These were judges
appointed during the fair, to see that the franchises
were preserved, and to take cognizance of contests
that might arise between traders there. Every fair
was to have two wardens, one chancellor to keep
the seal, two lieutenants, forty notaries, and 100 serjeants.
The wardens and chancellors were sworn
in the Chamber of Accounts, Paris, <i>where they were
yearly to make their report of the state of the fairs</i>.
No judgment might be given during the fair but
by the two wardens, or when one was unavoidably
absent, by one warden and the chancellor.</p>

<p>3. <i>How goods were to be brought within the
franchise.</i>—The drapers and traders of the seventeen
cities of Champagne and Brie frequenting the fairs—that
is to say those of the cities in which one of
these seventeen fairs was held—might not sell their
cloths or other stuffs, wholesale or retail, within or
without the kingdom, <i>unless first sent to one of the
fairs and exposed for sale from the first day appointed
for the sale of cloth until the sixth following</i>, on pain
of forfeiture; they being, however, at liberty to
dispose of them as they pleased, if not sold in that
time.</p>

<p>Farmers, curriers, &amp;c., must bring their leather
to the fair, and expose it all together from the first
of the three days, without reserving any for the last
days, <i>or selling in any other place than that designed
for the sale of leather</i>.</p>

<p>Horse-dealers, both subjects and foreigners, must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
have their stables in the said fairs from the third
day of the cloths (<i>i.e.</i> fixed for the sale of cloth)
until the fair ended.</p>

<p>In like manner all other wares brought into the
fair were to remain on sale, some for six days, others
for three days only, according to their nature and
quality.</p>

<p>4. <i>Inspections.</i>—These were of two kinds, one by
the wardens conservators, and the other by examiners
chosen out of the trading companies frequenting
the fair. The wardens’ inspection was at
the opening of every fair, to see that the dealers
had all suitable convenience and security—the inspectors
being properly qualified judges of the
character of the goods brought, with authority to
stop and seize all that were of inferior quality; but
this not without appeal to six, five, or four persons
experienced in the particular trade.</p>

<p>5. <i>Payments, Bonds, and Exchanges.</i>—All tradesmen,
alike French and foreigners, might agree in
their contracts for payment of goods sold in the
fair—to be paid in gold and silver current at the
time of making the contract, notwithstanding any
ordinance concerning money to the contrary. Interest
for loans, and goods sold on credit at fairs,
might not exceed fifteen per cent. The interest
might not be added to the principal in renewing
bonds made at fairs. Nor might bonds made at
any other time run in the style of those used at fairs,
as if made there.</p>

<p>All letters, acts, contracts, &amp;c., relating to fairs,
to be null <i>unless under the authenticated seal of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
fairs</i>. None unless he had actual residence in fairs
might use the seal or other obligations, or enjoy the
privileges thereof.</p>

<p>The re-establishment of these privileges—many
of which were obviously made in the interest of
merchants attending to buy—had the effect of restoring
the fairs of these provinces to their former
greatness. Again multitudes of traders came from
Germany, Italy (particularly from Florence), Lucca,
Venice, and Genoa, with gold, silver, and silk stuffs,
spices and other goods of their country, or of the
Levant, taking in exchange cloths, leather and
other commodities, not only the produce of the provinces,
but brought from other parts of France.</p>

<p>I speak of the fair of <i>Troyes</i> separately hereafter,
on account of one of its distinguishing features.</p>

<p>Mr. Morley has pointed out that before the
establishment of free fairs in France, the rights of
<i>salutaticum</i>, <i>pontaticum</i>, <i>repaticum</i>, and <i>portulaticum</i>,
absorbed one half of a foreign merchant’s goods
upon their first arrival and debarkation. Afterwards
traders came exempt not only from imperial
taxation, but from many of the ordinary risks of
travel.</p>

<p>One great element of interest in these fairs centres
in the circumstance of the following correspondence
between the Wardens of the fair and the Lord
Mayor of London concerning dealings in these
fairs in the thirteenth century. They have been
carefully preserved amongst the records of the City
for six centuries—and now for the first time gain
the glory of printer’s ink. They reveal a feature in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
the comity of nations; and present a proof of the
cosmopolitan interests of commerce which can
scarcely be excelled. Hence I propose to give them
entire:</p>

<p>1. <i>Letter directed to the Mayor by the Keepers of
the Fairs of Champagne and Brie, dated September
1299.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To the venerable man, the provident, wise and
discreet Warden of London, or to his vicegerent,
Peter de Fremeville, knight, and Robert de Champagne
(<i>de Campaniis</i>), keepers of the fairs of Champagne
and Brie for our most illustrious Lord the
King of the French, increase of all good with
greeting and sincere affection. Whereas heretofore,
by our letters patent sealed with the seal of the fairs
of Champagne, we have entreated you to compel,
or cause to be compelled, the burgess Fauberti, a
citizen of Florence and horse-dealer (<i>mercatorem
equorum</i>), together with Guido Fauberti, Nutus (or
Nuto) Fauberti, brothers of the said burgess, Master
Gerald de Galaiòn physician, [and] James son of
the said Nutus, associates of the said burgess, by the
sale of their goods and the seizure of their bodies,
sending them back to us, to yield and pay to
Pucheus de Pré (<i>de Prato</i>), formerly horse-dealer
in the said fairs, Martin de Burgo novo, brother of
John de Burgo now deceased formerly horse-dealer,
and John de Burgo novo, nephew of the said John
deceased and of Martin aforesaid, or to the bearer
of our said letters for them, one thousand six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
petits livres Tournois with sufficient damages
and expenses; and to satisfy us concerning the said
King’s amends for default of the fairs. In which
sum of money they are held effectually bounden,
and every of them in the whole, for the body of the
fairs of Bani (<i>Bari</i>) <i>super Albam</i> from the year of
Our Lord 1292, as well by reason and because of
certain pledges made and committed in and upon
the body of the said fairs, as by reason and because
of the restitution of more sureties and more costs
and damages, which by default of the said burgess
and his associates before mentioned in and upon the
body of the said fairs they had and were said to
have incurred: as in certain open letters of definitive
sentence sealed with the seal of the said fairs is
said to be contained. Upon which things Tolnetus
[elsewhere Nicholas] called Concesse, our sworn servant
in the said fairs, by word of mouth related to
us that he in the year of Our Lord 1293 presented
to you our aforesaid letters (as he says), which
deprecatory letters of ours directed to you if forsooth
you received, yet you willed not to demand
due execution of the same, or to write back any
answer to us, although at the end it was duly contained
that what you should do therein, you would
will and deign by your letters to write back, and
although in presence of many trustworthy persons
you were so requested by our said servant; on the
ground that war was begun and raised between the
most excellent princes, the King of France and
King of England: as our said sworn servant on oath
has related all these things to be true, whereat we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
most greatly marvel, if it is so and we hold ourselves
not contemned, since this is to the no mean
damage and grievance of the said creditors, and
prejudice and contempt of the government of the
said fairs committed unto us, because on account of
the war aforesaid you were by no means bound to
keep back our said letters deprecatory demanding
due execution. Wherefore as much as we can with
diligence on behalf of our most excellent lord, John
by the grace of God, King of France and Navarre,
Lord of Champagne and Brie, and on our part, by
the tenor of these presents, we move your providence
to be entreated, that you do cause all the
goods of the aforesaid burgess Fauberti and his
associates before named and of the said company to
be solemnly proclaimed for sale, and to be sold and
divided without delay to the uses and customs of
fairs, or so much of them that out of the price of
the sale the said creditors (or, for them, the bearer
of these presents) as to the aforesaid sum of money
with sufficient damages and expenses, and we, as to
the amends of our said lord the King, be wholly
satisfied; and that the body of the said burgess
Fauberti together with the bodies of his associates
aforenamed—if they can be found in your jurisdiction,
and if the sale of goods does not suffice for
the premises—you do send back to us to the fairs
in sure and faithful custody to pay among them the
charges of the creditors, and to clear themselves
before us in this matter as to the uses and customs
beforesaid. If, however, you wish to put forward
any thing contrary to the report of our said servant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
and believe your own interests to be concerned, be
present in person before us, or, for yourself, send at
a fitting day which the bearer of these presents shall
cause to be named to you, to say what shall seem to
you expedient. Otherwise, we shall then hold the
said report to be fast and firm, you doing thereupon,
on account of the reverence and honour due to our
aforesaid lord the King and the intervention of our
prayers, because we are bounden to you and yours
in all manner of favours deserved, such and so much
as you would wish us to do for you in the like or
a greater case. What you shall do herein, have a
care to signify to us by the bearer of these presents
in your letters patent together with the present
letters demanding execution sent back, notwithstanding
that they shall not be presented to you by
the servant of the fairs. Given in the year of Our
Lord one thousand two hundred and ninety-nine in
the month of September.</p>

<p>2. <i>Letter sent to the Keepers of the Fairs of Champagne
and Brie, dated March 19, 1299-1300.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To the noble men and discreet lords Peter de
Fremeville knight and Robert de Champagne
keepers of the fairs of Champagne and Brie for the
lord the King of France, Elias Russel, Mayor, and
the Citizens of London, Greeting and continual increase
of sincere affection. Whereas you lately
wrote unto us that we should compel the burgess
Fauberti &amp;c. [named as before] as well by sale of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
their goods as by seizure of their bodies and also
sending them to you, to render to Pucheus de Pré
formerly horse-dealer, Martin de Burgo novo and
other creditors in your letters comprised, or to the
bearer of your said letters, 1,600 petit livres Tournois
together with damages and expenses, and also
the amends of the Lord the King for default of
fairs; in which sum of money the aforesaid dealers
(<i>mercatores</i>), and every of them in the whole, are
bound by their letters made in the fairs of Bari
<i>super Albam</i>, by reason of divers contracts between
them before had from the year of Our Lord 1292,
as in your letters thereupon to us directed more
fully is contained: We willing, so far as the laws
and customs of England permit, by mutual interchange
to comply with your prayers, have caused
to come before us, in the presence of John de
Flekers your servant and bearer of the presents, the
aforesaid burgess and Nutus, dealers, to answer to
your said servant concerning the said debt according
to the form of your letters, which said dealers asserted
that they are quit of all the aforesaid, because
of them all they sufficiently satisfied the said creditors,
and therein proffered a letter of Gencian de
Paris, baker (<i>panetarii</i>) of the King of France, and
Robert de Champagne, keepers of the fairs of
Champagne and Brie sealed with the seal of the fairs
of Champagne, in which it is contained that the
said burgess, for himself, his brothers, and associates,
in the fairs of Bari super Albam in the year of Our
Lord 1293, appeared in person before the said
keepers, and spoke with the said Pucheus and compounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
with him under such form that the said
Pucheus held himself as paid by the said burgess,
his brothers and associates abovesaid, by reason of
the said composition, as the said Pucheus before the
said keepers acknowledged and wholly assented to
the said composition for himself and his associates.
And because by the letters aforesaid it appeared that
the said burgess and his associates by the said composition
are totally quit of the debt aforesaid, we
could not by your mandate lawfully compel them
to pay the said money. Given at London on
Saturday next before Mid-Lent in the year of Our
Lord 1299.</p>

<p>3. <i>Second letter</i> [of the Keepers] <i>of the Fairs of
Champagne and Brie for the burgess Fuberti to the
Lord Mayor, dated May 1300.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To the provident men, the venerable and honorable
Mayor and Citizens of London, or their vicegerents,
or one of them, Peter de Fremville, knight,
and Robert de Champagne, keepers of the fairs of
Champagne and Brie, continual increase of sincere
affection with greeting. Whereas we, by our letters
patent sealed with the seal of the said fairs, have
many times (<i>pluries</i>) prayed and requested you to
compel and cause to be compelled the burgess Fouberti,
citizen of Florence and horse-dealer by seizure
of his body and goods, and also by the sale of the
goods of Guido Fouberti &amp;c. [as before], to satisfy
Pucheus de Pré formerly in the said fairs horse-dealer,
Martin &amp;c. [as before], on and of the sum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
(that is to say) of 1060 [for 1600] petits livres
Tournois with moderate damages and costs, in
which sum of money the said burgess Fouberti together
with his associates aforesaid is held bound to
the beforenamed Pucheus, Martin and John, as
debtor, concerning the body of the past fairs of
Barri <i>super Albam</i> in the year of Our Lord 1293,
as well by reason and because of certain pledges
made and committed in and upon the body of the
abovesaid fairs, as by reason and because of the restitution
of more sureties and more costs and damages
which by default of the said burgess and his associates
beforementioned in and upon the body of the
said fairs they had and were said to have incurred,
as in certain letters of definitive sentence sealed with
the seal of the fairs of Champagne is said to be contained:
upon which, first, you would make no answer
to us, or for our said letters deprecatory demand
any execution, as Nicholas called Concesse our
sworn servant, bearer of our said letters (as he said),
reported to us on oath by word of mouth; but
upon the tenor of our second letters which you
caused to be detained with you—as John de Flichers
our sworn servant, bearer of the same (as he says)
related to us with his own mouth—upon these
things with certain closed letters you wrote back,
that you caused to come before you in presence of
the said John de Flichers the aforesaid burgess and
Nutus, dealers, according to the form of our letters
to answer to our said servant concerning the said
debt. Which said dealers asserted they were quit
of all the abovesaid, because of all these they duly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
satisfied the said creditors &amp;c. [reciting what was
said in the last]. By the course of these presents
we thus hereupon notify to you that the said sum
of money has not yet been in any way satisfied, as
Dignus de Pré, son and heir (as it is said) of
Pucheus deceased, has given us to understand. And
assuredly, moreover, as soon as the said burgess on
account of the things aforesaid appeared before you,
and alleged the things contained in your answer,
you ought to have taken into your hand his goods
and those of his said associates, and to have fixed a
certain and fit day for him before you, as in our
letters abovesaid was contained; for the cognizance
of what relates to fairs belongs to no judge, but to
us only by reason of the government of fairs committed
unto us. Wherefore, on the part of our
lord the King of France and on our own part, we
again ask your providences to cause without delay
so much of the goods of the said burgess and his
associates aforesaid to be taken, sold, and divided to
the uses and customs of fairs that the aforesaid
Dignus de Pré may be fully satisfied of the whole
sum of money aforesaid with damages and expenses,
and we, of the amends; and the body of the said
burgess, is the sale shall not suffice for the costs of
the said complainant, left on account of your default
<i>it behove us to inhibit the land and fairs of
Champagne and Brie to all your subjects and their
goods</i>. What you shall do herein, have a care to
signify to us in your letters patent by the bearer of
these presents, sending back the present letters together
with our other letters aforesaid detained with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
you, as has been said. Given in the year of Our
Lord 1300 in the month of May. J. de Sancto
Nabore.</p>

<p>4. <i>Letter from the Lord Mayor of London in answer
directed to the Keepers of the Fairs of Champagne</i>
[and Brie] <i>dated 20 Aug. 1300.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To the discreet and honourable men, if it please
their most dear friends, the lords Peter de Fremville,
knight, and Robert de Champagne, Wardens
of the fairs of Champagne and Brie for the illustrious
King of France, Elias Russel, Mayor of
London, and the Citizens of the same City, Greeting
and continual increase of sincere affection with
health. Whereas heretofore you wrote to us that
we should compel the burgess Fuberti, Citizen of
Florence, horse-dealer &amp;c. [naming the others as
before], as well by sale of their goods as by the
seizing of their bodies and sending them to you, to
render to Pucheus de Pré, formerly horse-dealer,
Martin de Burgo novo, and other creditors in your
said letters comprised, or to the bearer of the said
letters, 1600 petits livres Tournois together with
damages and expenses, and also amends of the Lord
the King for default of the fairs; in which sum of
money the said burgess and his associates, by their
letters made in your fairs beforesaid, are bound by
reasons of divers contracts between them had belonging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
to the year of Our Lord 1293; as in your
letters thereupon to us directed more fully is contained:
We, as much as in us lies, and as the
customs and rights of the Realm of England permit
us to do, willing to comply altogether with your
prayers and requests, have made to come before us,
in the presence of your servant the bearer of the
presents, the said burgess and Nutus whom we
found in our jurisdiction. Nevertheless we sequestered
their goods in the presence of your servant
putting upon them concerning the said debt, as is
contained in your letters aforesaid. And your
letters being heard and understood, the said traders
(<i>mercatores</i>) asserted that they are not bound of right
to answer to your said letters, because in your letters
secondly to us directed (as you assert) it was contained
that the said burgess and his associates before
you in your fairs in the year of Our Lord 1292
bound themselves, upon which obligation they proffered
a certain letter of satisfaction of the said debt,
sealed with the seal of the fairs of Champagne and
Brie. In which said letter it was contained that the
said burgess before you compounded with the said
Pucheus, to which composition he the said Pucheus
assented; and in these your letters now to us directed
it is contained that the said burgess and his associates
in the year of Our Lord 1293 bound themselves
before you in your fairs: at which writing we
marvel. Moreover, at the time in which your said
letters were directed unto us, our lord the illustrious
King of England was in his war of Scotland with
whom at present we have not been able to consult,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
nor are the said burgess and his associates of the
liberty of our City of London: on which account,
without the special mandate of our Lord the King
of England we dared not move a hand toward the
seizing of their bodies, or send the said burgess and
others out of the Realm of England. Therefore
we request and earnestly entreat your lordships that
at present in this charge you will hold us excused
from the actions abovesaid, and deign to write to
our Lord the illustrious King of England upon the
aforesaid debts and requests; and those things which
shall be commanded us for the advantage of the
said creditors, and for your good pleasure, we will
dispatch without delay, and to the utmost of our
power. Farewell in Him who is the salvation of
all men. Given at London on Saturday next after
the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin
Mary in the year of Our Lord 1300.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I have now to notice some of the
other great fairs of France. And here
it has to be remarked that while the
later sovereigns—certainly down to
Louis XV.—adopted the regulations already reviewed,
for their model in the government of fairs,
yet that there were some necessary deviations, according
as time, place, and other circumstances
demanded. The chief of these deviations will be
noted in the following summary, wherein I review
the provincial fairs first, and afterwards those in
and around Paris.</p>

<p>Postlethwayt, in his “Dictionary of Trade,”
from which some of the preceding and following
details are drawn, remarks, not with entire clearness:
“Though it be not essential to these meetings
of traders to have comedians, rope-dancers, and
the like, yet there are few considerable ones without
enough of them; and, perhaps, is what greatly contributes
to the trade of them—the nobility and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
country gentry greatly flocking to them, more for
their diversion than what they buy there, which
might be had, perhaps, better and cheaper at home.
It is well known how the nobility of Languedoc
flock to the fair of Beaucaire, and those of Normandy
to that of Guibray; but it is nothing in comparison
to the assembly of German princes and
nobles at the three fairs of Leipzic, and the two of
Frankfort-on-the-Main.” He was writing in the
first half of the last century. Things are now much
changed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beaucaire</span> (in Languedoc).—An important town,
whose manufactures consist of silks, red wines, taffetas,
olive oil, and pottery. But its trade is chiefly
due to its great fair, held annually between 1st and
28th July, the site extending from the Rhône to
the base of the Castle Rock. This fair was established
in 1217 by Raymond VI., Count of Toulouse,
and was for many ages attended by merchants
and manufacturers from all countries in Europe,
and even from Persia and Armenia. Arthur Young
visited it in 1788, and records (“Travels in
France”) that the business transacted at it reached
10 million livres—£439,000. So late as 1833 it
drew together 60,000 persons, and the amount of
its transactions were stated to be 150 millions of
francs—£6,000,000! This would appear to be an
over-estimate.</p>

<p>I believe the fair now only lasts one week, namely
from 22nd to 28th July inclusive. It is a rule that
all bills must be presented on the 27th, and protested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
if necessary on 28th—last day of the fair. The
trade in linen and cloth is very large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besançon.</span>—This ancient city, a great centre of
warfare and of trade from the days of the Cæsars,
had once a fair of great celebrity. At a later period
it was chiefly notable for carrying on the business
of exchange. This business had been perfected at
the fairs of Lyons, from whence it passed here. On
the first day of the fair the merchants of a certain
standing announced the terms on which they were
willing to exchange with different countries, and on
the second day an authoritative declaration was
made of the fair terms of exchange with any foreign
country. For this purpose, with the constant fluctuations
in all actual coinage, it was necessary to
have a unit which should be common to all lands,
and free from the possibility of depreciation. Hence
everything was reckoned by means of an imaginary
unit—<i>scutus marcharum</i>, or money of account: so
that the form which the business took was not that of
buying bills, but of exchanging these fictitious coins,
made realizable in one town, for quantities of actual
coinage of another country, according to the
authoritatively declared rate, which took account
of the difficulty of transport, and of various risks.
A scutus marcharum was worth in Genoa 67⅓ soldi
of the actual coinage of the place. The question to
be settled was what, at this time, shall be paid in
Piacenza for a scutus marcharum in Genoa? This
was the fair rate of exchange, and the announcement
of it was intended to exclude the operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
of private speculators (in which it was not entirely
successful), and to secure a division of the advantage
among each of the parties transacting business. <i>Vide</i>
Cunningham’s “English Industry and Commerce,”
1882, p. 278.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bordeaux.</span>—This city has or had two fairs
annually—one commencing on the 1st March, the
other on the 15th October; they each continued
fifteen days. The October fair was generally the
more considerable.</p>

<p>The chief commodities disposed of were wines and
brandies, and it was no unusual sight to see several
hundreds of vessels beyond the usual average
number in the port, some of these being of unusually
large tonnage.</p>

<p>The fairs had the same privileges with those of
Champagne, Lyons, Paris, and Poictou. The consular
judges performed the office of conservators,
with the same jurisdiction as those of Lyons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caen</span> (Normandy).—This free fair was once
very famous. It begins the day after Low Sunday,
and lasts fifteen days, of which the first eight were
designated the “great week,” the other portion the
lesser, because formerly the franchises lasted only
the first eight; and because the concourse of
strangers was much greater during the early week
of the fair.</p>

<p>The merchants dealt in merchandise of all kind,
but woollen manufactures were the great speciality.
The shops in which the dealers expose their goods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
here are designated “Lodges.” A considerable
number of horses and of cattle were brought to
it from the provinces of Normandy. This fair
was regarded as next in importance to that of
Guibray.</p>

<p>It seems that in 1433 there was an attempt to
despoil this fair, by an attack of 700 horsemen, of
which I find the following brief record:—“Whereupon
they sent the Lord Ambrose de Lore, with
vii. c. horsemen, to robbe and spoyle the poore
people, commynge to the faier, on the daye of
Sainct Michaell the Archangell, kepte in the
Suberbes of the toune of Caen.”—<i>Hall</i>, Hen. VI.
ann. ii.</p>

<p>During the year several smaller and ordinary
fairs are held for the sale of horses, cattle, butter,
and poultry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dieppe.</span>—This is a free fair of comparatively
modern date, said to be the last authorized in
France, having been founded by letters patent in
1696. It was first opened on 1st December that
year. It continues for fifteen days. All foreigners
are at liberty freely to trade here, and goods declared
to be for the fair are not liable to seizure
while the fair lasts; nor were they liable to inspection
by the wardens—a relaxation of practice apparently
not quite in the interest of the buyers.</p>

<p>Its franchises and privileges are, that all goods
brought into the port of Dieppe during the fair, and
there sold or bartered, are exempt from one moiety
of duties inwards and outwards. And merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
imported and not sold during the fair may be
carried out free of customs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guibray</span> (Lower Normandy).—A fair of very
considerable importance, lasting from 10th to 25th
August, was held here. Arthur Young, of agricultural
fame, describes in his “Travels in France”
(1788), a visit to it on 22nd August, and records as
follows: “At this fair of Guibray merchandise is
sold, they say, to the amount of six millions
(£260,500) ... I found the quantity of English
goods considerable, hard and queen’s ware; cloth
and cottons. A doz. of common plain knives,
3 livres; and 4 livres for a French imitation, but
much worse.” It was a feature of this fair that the
resident gentry for long distances around came here
to make their purchases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lyons.</span>—It has been supposed that the ancient
fairs of this city were founded on a special privilege
granted by the Roman conquerors. They are four
in number—the first is that of the <i>Epiphany</i>, which
always begins in January, the Monday after the
twelfth day; the second is <i>Easter</i> fair, beginning on
<i>St. Nisier’s</i> day in April; the third in August,
which begins on <i>St. Dominick’s</i> day in that month;
and the fourth is the fair of <i>All Saints</i>, beginning
on St. Hubert’s day, in November. The situation
of this city, at the confluence of the Saône and
the Rhône, render it unrivalled for the facilities of
water carriage through some of the richest parts of
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>These fairs were of the highest mercantile repute,
and at a very early period bills of exchange were
brought into requisition in the adjustment of the
accounts for merchandise purchased there. It seems
also that bills resulting from commercial dealings in
many other parts of Europe were made payable at
the Lyons fairs.</p>

<p>Fixed days for payment followed each fair. The
ceremonies attending these days were as follows:
The chief magistrate came to the lodge of the Exchange,
accompanied by his registrar and six syndics,
viz., two French, two Italian, and two Swiss or
Germans; and there, after a short discourse to the
assistants, recommending probity in trade, and observance
of the laws, customs, and usages of the
place, the laws, customs, and usages were read <i>in
extenso</i>; and the clerk drew up a process verbal of
the opening of the “payment.” The next day they
met at the City-hall, and by plurality of voices
<i>settle the course of exchange for all cities with which
Lyons had any commercial correspondence</i>. This custom
prevailed for some centuries; and even when
the strict regulations here described were frequently
departed from, the regulations were capable of being
enforced on appeal.</p>

<p>When bills were drawn to be paid at one of these
appointed times at Lyons, which had not then
begun, the drawer said “pay this my first of Exchange,
&amp;c., in the next Epiphany (or other) payment;”
but if the payment had already begun, the
bill had to be drawn payable “in this current or
present payment of Epiphany” (or other term).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
The bills so drawn were to be accepted in the first
six days of the payment they were made payable in;
and the person on whom they were drawn was not
obliged to declare whether he would or not accept
until the sixth day. But after that day the bearer
might protest them for non-acceptance, though he
might detain them during the whole time of that
“payment,” to see whether any one offered to discharge
them. The protest, however, was immediately
forwarded to the remitters; and if any one
paid a bill in the time of the payment before the
sixth day (or that being a feast day, the day following)
it was at his own risk.</p>

<p>The bearers of bills not satisfied by the last day
of any “payment” were to protest them on the third
day after the payment finished, otherwise they lost
their right as against the drawers; but if this were
done in form, and in the time prescribed, the holder
might afterwards refuse payment from any one that
offered it, and take his reimbursement upon the
drawer, alike for principal and charges. And the
said holders of bills were obliged to take their reimbursement
on the drawers or indorsers in a time
limited, viz., for all bills drawn from any part of
<i>France</i>, in two months; those which were from
<i>Italy</i>, <i>Switzerland</i>, <i>Germany</i>, <i>Holland</i>, <i>Flanders</i>, and
<i>England</i>, in three months; and those which were
drawn from <i>Spain</i>, <i>Portugal</i>, <i>Poland</i>, <i>Sweden</i>, and
<i>Denmark</i>, in six months, to be counted from the
date of the protest; or in default thereof they lost
their rights against the drawers and indorsers. See
<i>Besançon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>The general reader must pardon these details,
which are of commercial significance. It was customary
at an early period to make the bills drawn
from Amsterdam and elsewhere on the “payment”
of Lyons, in “golden crowns of the sun;” but when
this specie became decried in France, the usage of
exchange came to be to draw for the payment of
Lyons (as was practised in France generally), viz.,
in crowns of sixty sous, equal to the present English
half-crown. These practices may be compared with
the usages of Nuremburg, Frankfort, and Leipzig
fairs.</p>

<p>The franchises of the fairs of Lyons in the early
half of the last century had this special feature:
that all goods intended for foreign countries, sent
out of this city during the fifteen days of either fair,
paid no customs outwards, provided the bales and
parcels were marked with the city arms, and had
certificates of franchise properly made out. To
enjoy this privilege the merchandise had to be sent
out of the kingdom before the first day of the
following fair, unless special permission for delay
had been obtained.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that a considerable
trade in books was transacted at these fairs during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>These fairs have a great history, which cannot be
followed up here, and there is the less need to
make the attempt because the inquiry is already in
competent hands, those of Mr. Chancellor Christie,
of Darley House, Matlock. The authorities which
may be consulted are the following:—</p>

an average to some 12,000 pieces at each fair.</p>

the one called Candlemas fair, beginning on the

opening the day after the festival. They each continued
fifteen days, and were much frequented by
foreigners, particularly the Dutch, British (English
and Scotch), and those of other northern nations;
its advantageous position for trade, by reason of
facilities of water carriage, offering great inducements
to the concourse of foreign traders.</p>

<p>Goods sold and exchanged at these fairs, and
carried out of the city during the fifteen days, paid
but half dues outwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toulon.</span>—This town—the Plymouth of France—has
a fair, not designated “free,” which commences
on 3rd November, and continues “fifteen
working days.” Its franchises, granted in 1708,
were that no goods while it lasts are subject to any
duties; and all traders, alike French and foreigners,
enjoy the franchises and liberties granted to the fairs
of Lyons, Brie, Champagne, Rouen, and other
cities. These underwent some modifications in the
following year, at the instance of the farmers-general
of the revenues of France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troyes.</span>—This town (one of the cities in Champagne)
was noted in the middle ages for its great
fairs, of which there were two—one being fixed to
the Monday after the Second Sunday in Lent; the
other commencing on 1st September. Philip of
Valois granted the privileges of these fairs.</p>

<p>A lasting record of the importance of the dealings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
thereat is handed down to us in the form of
“Troy (Troyes) weight,” used in connection with
dealings in the precious metals. It is said that this
system of weights was brought from Cairo by the
crusaders, and was first and permanently adopted as
the standard of weight in the dealings of the fairs
of Troyes. Hence it may be inferred that the
trading was largely in the precious metals, in spices,
and in drugs.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Goods sold at these fairs were exempted from all
customs outwards, local dues excepted, under certain
restrictions.</p>

<p>It is recorded especially of these fairs, that they
had a staff of notaries for the attestation of bargains,
courts of justice, police officers, sergeants for the
execution of the market judges’ decrees, and visitors—the
<i>prud’hommes</i>—whose duty it was to examine
the quality of goods exposed for sale, and to confiscate
those found unfit for consumption. The
confiscation required the consent of five or six representatives
of the merchant community at the
fair.</p>

<p>Sismondi, in his “History of the Italian Republics,”
writing of the events of the thirteenth
century, says:</p>

<p>The Tuscan and Lombard merchants however
trafficked in the barbarous regions of the West, to
carry there the produce of their industry. Attracted
by the franchises of the Fairs of <i>Champagne</i> and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
<i>Lyons</i>, they went thither, as well to barter their
goods <i>as to lend their capital at interest to the
nobles, habitually loaded with debt</i>; though at the
risk of finding themselves suddenly arrested, their
wealth confiscated by order of the King of France,
and their lives too sometimes endangered by sanctioned
robbers, under the pretext of repressing usury.
Industry, the employment of a superabundant capital,
the application of mechanism and science to the
production of wealth, secured the Italians a sort of
monopoly through Europe: they alone offered for
sale what all the rich desired to buy; and notwithstanding
the various oppressions of the barbarian
kings, notwithstanding the losses occasioned by their
own oft-repeated revolutions, their wealth was
rapidly renewed.</p>

<p><i>Inspectors of Fairs.</i>—In the course of the preceding
notices of the chief fairs of France various
references have been made to the inspection of
goods, as forming part of the regulations of such fairs.
These inspectors were appointed by the state. It
was their business to attend at all fairs where there
was any considerable trade in woollen and other
textile fabrics; to inspect and mark them; and if
deficient or not conformable to the authorized regulations,
to seize them. Such examination it is
obvious required to be made with great circumspection
and reserve, and at hours suited to the convenience
alike of buyers and sellers. The inspectors
were usually accompanied, in the performance of
their duties, by the judge of the police of manufactures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
and the wardens and jurats of trades in the
respective places.</p>

<p>Some free fairs had their own judges and particular
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>An examination of M. Bottin’s “View of the
Fairs of France” goes to show that they took place
mostly on the frontiers of the kingdom, or on the
marches of ancient provinces; or at the foot of
high mountains, or at the beginning or end of the
snow season, which for months shuts up the inhabitants
in their valleys; or in the neighbourhood of
the famous cathedrals or churches frequented by
flocks of pilgrims; or in the middle of rich pasture
tracks. But there are some marked exceptions to
these rules.</p>

<p>The establishment and abolition of fairs—with
the exception of cattle markets and the markets of
the metropolis—are now generally left to the discretion
of the departmental prefects.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FAIRS OF PARIS.</span></h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The City of Paris had fairs in great
variety, some of which I now proceed
to notice.</p>

<p><i>St. Denis</i> or <i>Lendit Fair</i>.—One of
the earliest, perhaps the first, was the mercantile
fair of St. Denis, chartered early in the seventh
century by Dagobert “in honour of the Lord and
to the glory of St. Denys at his festival.” This fair,
by reason of the privileges granted, became known
under the name of the <i>forum idictum</i>—whence
<i>l’indict</i>, and its corruption to <i>landit</i> and <i>lendit</i>. To
it came the iron and lead of the Saxons, the slaves
of the northern nations, the jewellery and perfumes
of the Jews, the oil, wine and fat of Provence and
Spain, the honey and madder of Neustria and Brittany,
the merchandise of Egypt and the East.</p>

<p>The fair, which lasted ten days from the 10th of
October, was opened by a procession of monks from
the Abbey of St. Denis; and in later times it was
usual for the Parliament of Paris to allow itself a
holiday, called Landi, in order that its members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
might take part in the great marriage-feast of commerce
and religion: just as the English Parliament
usually finds relaxation in horse-flesh and mammon
on the “Derby day” at Epsom!</p>

<p>English merchants frequented this fair in the
ninth century, <i>vide</i> Cunningham’s “English Industry
and Commerce,” 1882, p. 82.</p>

<p>But St. Denis had another fair, at one time
famous, to which tradition has accorded the following
origin. The Paris Cathedral received from
Constantinople, in 1109, some fragments of the
cross, regarded as authentic. The populace could
not find room in the church where they were deposited
in any one day; hence the bishop carried
them in great pomp to the plain of St. Denis, where
there was room enough for the vast concourse of
worshippers who assembled to contemplate and
adore. This ceremony and procession were renewed
at stated periods. The schools of the cloister of
Notre Dame had early taken part in the processions;
and finally the students of the University of Paris
claimed it as a patron festival, which it certainly
was not.</p>

<p>In process of time a mart or fair became established
on the recurrence of this Church festival.
The ground was regarded as consecrated for the
purpose. On each 12th of June (the day after the
festival of St. Barnabas) the procession took place.
It was at a later period called the “Feast of the
Parchment.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the day of procession, the
students, attired in their best, assembled on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
at the top of Mount St. Geneviève, to accompany
the Rector of the University, who, arrayed in his
scarlet cloak, and wearing his doctor’s cap, proceeded
on a mule or hackney, accompanied by
the deans, proctors and myrmidons, to the plain of
St. Denis, where the market for the sale of parchment
was already opened. The rector upon
reaching the fair caused to be put aside as much
parchment as would be required by the University
for the coming year, and received from the sellers
a donation equivalent to £100 of the present day.
This I assume was the toll paid for the right of
holding the fair.</p>

<p>After this the students alighted from their horses,
and instead of forming part of the procession back
to Paris, amused themselves at the fair. This invariably
led to riot and disorder, and not a year
passed without blood being spilt. Thus from the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the decrees of parliament
against the carrying of arms or sticks, which
were continually being renewed and always neglected,
testify to the gravity of the evil, and to the difficulties
of putting an end to it.</p>

<p>At last, in 1566, the fair was transferred from
the plain to the town of St. Denis, and at about the
same period paper began to supersede parchment
even for public documents. The rector, therefore,
ceased getting a supply of parchment at the fair,
and the students having no further pretext for attending,
it speedily fell into disuse. By the beginning
of the seventeenth century the only vestige of
it left was the general holiday which the rector<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
granted to the students of the University upon the
first Monday after the feast of St. Barnabas, <i>vide</i>
Lecroix’s “Science and Literature in the Middle
Ages,” pp. 34-36.</p>

<p><i>St. Germain.</i>—This fair was held in a large permanent
building specially provided, constituting
something like twin market halls, elegantly constructed
of timber, and long regarded as models of
construction. The two halls embraced nine streets
in line intersecting each other and divided into
twenty-four sections or aisles; the shops having
little rooms or store-houses over them, and behind
some of them were open spaces, with wells—regarded
as of importance in case of fire, although
not proving of much avail when the event occurred.
The streets were distinguished by the names of the
different trades conducted in them—as Goldsmiths’
Street, Mercers’ Street, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fair was opened the day after Candlemas
Day. It was greatly frequented by traders from
Amiens, Beaumont, Rheims, Orleans, and Nugent,
with various sorts of cloth and textile fabrics. The
goldsmiths, jewellers, and toymen of Paris made a
fine display of their wares.</p>

<p>There were brought to this fair, one year with
another, some 1,400 bales of cloth and other woollen
stuffs, of which the inspector of manufactures at the
Custom-house, Paris, was required to keep a particular
register. Two inspectors of the fair were
required to be present at the opening of the bales of
goods. There was also a further inspection made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
by the Masters and Wardens of the Guilds of Drapery
and Mercery.</p>

<p>I find a graphic account of this fair in Lister’s
“Travels in France,” 1698, which I here transcribe:</p>

<p>We were in Paris at the time of the fair of St.
Germain. It lasts six weeks at least; the place
where it is kept, well bespeaks its antiquity; for it is
a very pit or hole, in the middle of the Faubourg,
and belongs to the great abbey of that name. You
descend into it on all sides, and in some places above
twelve steps; so that the city is raised above it six
or eight foot.</p>

<p>The building is a very barn, or frame of wood,
tiled over; consisting of many long allies, crossing
one another, the floor of the allies unpaved, and of
earth, and as uneven as may be: which makes it
very uneasy to walk in, were it not the vast croud
of people which keep you up. But all this bespeaks
its antiquity, and the rudeness of the first ages of
Paris, which is a foil to its politeness in all things
else now.</p>

<p>The fair consists of most toy-shops, and Bartholomew-fair
ware; also fiance and pictures, joiner’s
work, linen and woollen manufactures; many of
the great ribband shops remove out of the Palais
hither; no books; many shops of confectioners,
where the ladies are commodiously treated.</p>

<p>The great rendezvous is at night, after the play
and opera are done; and raffling for all things
vendible is the great diversion; no shop wanting
two or three raffling boards. Monsieur, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Dauphin, and other princes of the blood come at
least once in the fair-time to grace it. Here are
also coffee-shops, where that and all sorts of strong
liquors ... are sold.</p>

<p>Knavery here is in perfection as with us; as dexterous
cut-purses and pick-pockets. A pick-pocket
came into the fair at night, extremely well-clad,
with four lacqueys with good liveries attending
him: he was caught in the fact, and more swords
were drawn in his defence than against him; but
yet he was taken, and delivered into the hands of
justice, which is here sudden and no jest.</p>

<p>I was surprized at the impudence of a booth,
which put out the pictures of some Indian beasts,
with hard names; and of four that were painted, I
found but two, and those very ordinary ones, viz. a
leopard, and a racoun. I asked the fellow, why he
deceived the people, and whether he did not fear
cudgelling in the end: he answered with a singular
confidence, that it was the painter’s fault; that he
had given the racoun to paint to two masters, but
both had mistaken the beast; but however (he
said) though the pictures were not well designed,
they did nevertheless serve to grace the booth and
bring him custom.</p>

<p><i>St. Laurence</i> (or <i>St. Laurent</i>).—So called from
its situation near St. Laurence’s Church. It is so
ancient that no date can be even approximately
fixed for its origin. Its chief traders were goldsmiths
and mercers, picture-painters, sempstresses,
lemonade-sellers, toymen, earthenware people, gingerbread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
bakers, &amp;c. &amp;c. To it came people from
Amiens, Beauvais, Rheims, and other places of
Picardy and Champagne, with light fabrics, both
plain and striped, and camlets of all sorts.</p>

<p>The fair seems originally to have lasted but one
day; but the period gradually became extended to
two months, commencing the day after St. James’s
day and ending at Michaelmas. It was proclaimed
by sound of trumpet.</p>

<p>These two rival fairs had this peculiarity: they
were always open as bazaars. They were not fairs
in the usual sense of the term for more than three
months in the year. The St. Germain fair was
held in the winter, and the St. Laurent in the early
part of the summer. The former never recovered
its popularity after the fire which destroyed the
wooden constructions used during the fair (1763),
though by the erection of new galleries, more
elegant than the old ones, there was added to the
attractions of a fair a dancing-saloon, the Winter
Wauxhall, which was well attended for a time.</p>

<p>The St. Laurent fair was held in the upper part
of the faubourg of that name, was larger and more
elaborately decorated than the St. Germain fair, but
it had no Wauxhall, and the only amusements for
the frequenters of its Chinese Redoubt were swings
and other foreign games.</p>

<p><i>The St. Ovide Fair.</i>—This was established in
August, 1764, and was held in the very centre of
Paris, upon the Place Vendôme, then bounded on
one side by the church and convent of the Capucines.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
It was held there for some years, and then
transferred to the Place Louis XV., where it did
not last long, although it had originally been made
fashionable as the <i>Gingerbread Fair</i>. It was at this
fair that Nicolet, previous to establishing his theatre
<i>des grands danseurs du Roi</i>, displayed the wonderful
strength and agility which gave rise to the proverb
“<i>de plus fort en plus fort, comme chez Nicolet</i>.”—Lacroix,
“The Eighteenth Century,” p. 356.</p>

<p><i>Onion Fair of Notre Dame.</i>—This fair is held in
September, commencing with the feast of Notre
Dame, and continuing till the end of the month.
It is held on the Isle of Notre Dame, along the
Quai Bourbon. A prodigious quantity of black
and red onions are brought into the city at this
period, the citizens laying in a stock for the whole
year.</p>

<p><i>Pork or Bacon Fair.</i>—This “fair for gammons”
is held on the Tuesday in Passion Week in the street
of Notre Dame, lasting but the one day only.
There is sold at it immense quantities of hams,
flitches of bacon, and other salted pork. Many
amusing articles have been written concerning it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Horse and Cattle Fairs.</span></h3>

<p>The horse and cattle fairs of France were and
are very numerous. I shall give but a brief outline
of the chief or more remarkable. Those of
<i>Chénerailles</i> (a great town of Auvergne) are chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
famous for their fat cattle, brought for the most
part to Paris. The fairs are held the last Tuesday
in every month. The fairs of <i>Guibray</i> and <i>Caen</i>
are amongst the chief for horses. That of Fontenay,
in Poictou, for the horses bred in that province.
It is held 24th June, and is one of the most noted
in France. The fair at Niort, on 1st December,
is chiefly for foals. At <i>Nogent-sur-Seine</i>, is a
considerable horse fair, the 11th August. There
are three annual cattle fairs at <i>Braisne-le-Comte</i>, near
Soissons, viz. on 6th May, 14th September, and 14th
December. The greater part of the sales are for
Paris. The fairs of <i>Nangis</i> and <i>Crecy</i> in Brie, on 4th
July and 29th September respectively, are very considerable,
and from these the graziers and butchers
in the Isle of France are supplied. <i>Montely</i> is a fair
chiefly for cows, great numbers of which are brought
by the farmers and peasants about Paris and all the
Isle of France. It is held 9th September. There
are also several fairs for pigs held in the villages
around Paris, and innumerable other cattle and
horse fairs of lesser note, not calling for any particular
mention.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The modern growth of Russia is greater
than that of any other European country.
Its fairs have done much to facilitate
that growth. It seems as if its
people were passing through those stages of commercial
building up which the other nationalities
have long left in the dim vista of the past. The
greatest fair held in Europe at the present time is
that of <i>Nijni Novgorod</i>; yet that is not greater, relatively,
than was Sturbridge in England, or those
of Lyons, or of Bari (Italy), or of Bruges, in
Flanders. There are several other large fairs, of
which I shall also give the best details available.
They are chiefly in southern Russia. The fair of
Riga is an exception. The fair of Kiakhta is in
Asiatic Russia, as are also those of Irbit and
Yekaterinburg. I shall first notice the smaller fairs,
and finally that of Nijni.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berdicheff</span> (in the government of Volhynia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
southern Russia).—This town has long been famous
for its fairs. King Stanislaus Augustus permitted
the holding of ten in the year. Five either now
are or recently were held, viz. in January, March,
June, August, and November. Those of June and
August are the most considerable. These fairs have
given rise to the commercial importance of the
town. The chief trade of the fairs is in grain, wine,
honey, wax, leather, and horses and cattle; while
cotton and silk goods, glass-ware, hardware, salt,
fish, and beetroot sugar are becoming of increasing
importance. The value of the goods sold is estimated
at £800,000; the Jews are the chief purchasers.
At the principal horse fair there is sometimes
a show of 40,000 horses. The nobles of
the country with their families attend the fairs, and
remain encamped in the neighbourhood of the
town during the three weeks they last. At the
January fair, 1883, a circus was burned, and about
three hundred lives were lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizavetgrad</span> (southern Russia).—This town,
formerly designated “Fortress of St. Elizabeth,”
with its “Great Perspective,” and boulevard of
white acacias, has four annual fairs, the most important
of which is that of St. George, held on
23rd April (old style). The value of the goods
brought into the fair in 1863 was over £300,000.
The chief commodities of the district are tallow and
grain. The goods brought into it are those manufactured
at Odessa, Wilna, and Berdicheff. There
is also a daily market held here, with transactions
of considerable magnitude, especially after harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jitomir</span> (or Zytomiers), chief town in the province
of Volhynia, western Russia, has two annual
fairs—one in July, the other in August. Apart from
the trade at these, which is considerable, the ordinary
commerce of the town is small. There are
three markets weekly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karkoff.</span>—This town, situate in the administrative
province of the same name in southern Russia,
is a place of very considerable importance. It has
four fairs, the “Krestchenskaya” or Epiphany fair,
opened 6th January, being one of the most important
in the empire. In 1863 goods to the amount
of from two and a half to three millions sterling in
value were brought to that fair, the textile fabrics
alone representing a value of about one million
sterling. Cattle and wool constitute the local produce.
The wool sales take place exclusively at the
Trinity fair in June. Bazaars and markets are also
held on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. These
are particularly active immediately before Christmas
and Easter. This is one of the most pleasant districts
of Russia. The vine and the mulberry, with
other fruits, thrive here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kasan</span> (Kazan).—This, while an independent
state, had a considerable fair, one of the greatest in
Europe; but John the Terrible prevented Russian
merchants from attending it. In 1552 Kasan was
conquered by this same Ivan, and annexed to Russia.
See <i>Makariev</i> and <i>Nijni Novgorod</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Korennaya</span>, southern Russia, twenty-seven versts
from Kursk.—Two very large fairs are held, viz.
on the ninth Friday after Easter, and on the 8th
Sept. in each year. The cathedral within the
famous monastery of Bogoroditsky-Znamensky (<i>Apparition
of the Virgin</i>) contains a holy image held
in great veneration—that of the apparition of said
Holy Virgin, after whom the monastery is named.
Immense crowds follow the procession of the holy
image every year, at a period coincident with the
first fair. The monastery was founded in 1597.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kremenchuk.</span>—An important town in southern
Russia on the Dnieper, in which fairs are held at
end of January for fourteen days, on 24th June for
eleven days, and on 1st September (all old style)
for ten days. The business transacted is not large,
particularly having regard to the favourable situation.
In 1862 the sales of these fairs amounted to £85,000,
and the value of the goods brought to about
£110,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kursk.</span>—A town in southern Russia, on the
river Tuskor. Two fairs are held here—one in
April, the other in the tenth week after Easter.
There are also two weekly markets—Mondays and
Fridays. See also <i>Korennaya</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Makariev.</span>—The monks of the monastery of St.
Macarius (after which the town seems to be named)
by virtue of their charter established a fair here in
1641, after which annually in the month of July for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
space of three weeks the few wretched huts, built on
a sandy desert, were replaced by thousands of shops
erected with a promptitude peculiar to the Russians.
Taverns, coffee-houses, a theatre, ball rooms, a crowd
of wooden buildings painted and adorned with taste,
sprung up. People from many nations thronged
here in great multitudes: Russians from all the
provinces of the empire, Tartars, Tchuvaches, Teheremisses,
Calmuks, Bucharians, Georgians, Armenians,
Persians and Hindus; and in addition Poles,
Germans, French, and English. Notwithstanding the
confusion of costumes and languages, the most perfect
order prevailed: all were there for the purposes
of commerce. The riches which were gathered
there within the space of two leagues were said to
be incalculable. The silks of Lyons and Asia, the
furs of Siberia, the pearls of the East, the wines of
France and Greece, the merchandise of China and
Persia. These were brought in contrast with the
most ordinary articles of everyday life, in true
Eastern fashion. This fair was in truth one of the
developments of <i>Nijni Novgorod</i>, which see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orel.</span>—An important town in south-western
Russia founded by John the Terrible, about 1565,
for the defence of the Grand Duchy of Moscow
against the Tartars. The town has a large trade in
tallow and hemp, also in linseed oil, wheat, cattle,
timber and salt. This commerce has two outlets—the
one by land; the other by water down the Oka,
to Kaluga, Serpukhof, Kolomna, Murom, Nijni-Novgorod,
Rybinsk, and St. Petersburg. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
are three fairs annually—between 6th and 20th
January, during the fifth and sixth weeks after
Easter, and from 8th to 31st Sept. (O.S.) The
first is the least considerable of these. The market
or bazaar days are Fridays and Sundays. After
harvest as many as 10,000 carts enter the town
daily, laden with wheat and other produce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poltava</span>, southern Russia, on the river Vorskla,
long famous for the leeches found in its pools and
morasses, and which are largely and widely exported.
The importance of the trade of the town is chiefly
due to its fair (Ilyinskaya) held on 10th July, and
lasting a month. The average value of the goods
carried to this great commercial gathering is estimated
at about three and a half millions sterling.
The number of carts engaged in bringing the produce
from Moscow, Odessa, Kharkoff, Kursk and
Voronej is upwards of 20,000. Russian manufactures
are much sold, but wool is the great staple of
trade. Horses, cattle, and sheep are likewise bought
and sold in great numbers. There are two other
fairs—one on the feast of the Ascension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riga</span> (the capital of Livonia, Baltic Provinces)
had several centuries since, two considerable fairs,
one held in May, the other in September, very
much frequented by English, French, Dutch, and
other merchants. At the period of these fairs the
town wore a very commercial aspect, and the port
was thronged with ships. The local customs were
peculiar, and gave rise to difficulties. The townsmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
had priority in the selection of warehouses, and
in the sale of commodities, and as a result the vessels
of foreigners were unduly detained, and the selection
of the produce made in advance of their opportunities.
Hence it was recorded in the middle of the
last century that these fairs were on the decline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rostof</span>, on the river Don, near its mouth in the
sea of Azof (Lake Nero), and famous for its manufactures
of white lead, vermilion, and other mineral
and chemical substances; also for its linen manufacture.
Large fairs are held twice a year, when very
considerable numbers of cattle and horses change
ownership.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voronej</span>, on the Voronej river, near its confluence
with the Don; one of the most flourishing
towns in southern Russia. Its trade is in grain,
linseed, tallow. Four fairs are held annually, the
larger being those of 9th May and 29th August
(O.S.). Markets are held three times a week.</p>

<p class="dropcap">This may now be pronounced the great
mercantile fair of the world. It probably
bears a greater resemblance (but
on a larger scale) to that of Sturbridge
in its best days, than any other of past or present
times. It is almost the last remaining type (in
Europe) of the mediæval form of commerce. The
origin and early history of this fair are somewhat
obscure. Authentic records attest that mercantile
gatherings were held at Nijni so early as 1366;
and tradition points to a still earlier origin. Before
Kasan was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552,
Russian merchants were prohibited from attending
fairs in that province. A considerable fair then held
was the precursor of the present.</p>

<p>The Russians held a fair at another place on the
Volga. In 1641 the monks of the monastery of
St. Macarius, by virtue of their charter, founded a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
fair at <i>Makariev</i>, seventy-one miles below Nijni.
Of this fair I have already given some account.
“The monks of the monastery (says Michell) very
cleverly made Nijni a place of religious as well as
commercial resort, and levied taxes on the trade
which they fostered.” Up to 1751 the tolls had
still been collected by these monks; but in that year
the fair became the property of the State. In 1824
it definitely fixed at Nijni-Novgorod. It was probably
removed here temporarily in 1816, when the
town of Makariev was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The situation of the town opposite the confluence
of the Volga (having a course of 2,320 miles) and
Oka (with 900 miles of navigation) rivers, is pre-eminently
suitable for the purpose of commerce, of
which these rivers indeed, prior to the introduction
of railways, constituted the great arteries. The town
of Lower Novgorod was founded as early as 1222,
and was in 1237 occupied by the Tartars. When it
was taken from them, they declared perpetual warfare
against it, and sacked it more than once. By
means of the two large rivers named—which extend,
with their contributory streams and canal communication
with the Baltic, over a considerable portion
of northern, eastern and southern Russia—an easy
communication is maintained with the richest agricultural
and manufacturing provinces. The Kamma,
a tributary of the Volga, also affords water communication
with the remote provinces of Ural and parts
of Siberia. The productions of China are carried
during the month of September over the Baikal
Lake, and in spring reach the Volga along with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
Siberian caravans. The productions of Astrakhan,
Persia and Bokhara ascend that river, while those of
Petersburg, Germany, England, and France descend
it: so that the merchandise of the east and the west
meet as in a common centre here. And this line
of commerce dates back into far distant ages, promoted
and shared in by those trading monks who
took so leading a part in founding the great Hanseatic
League.</p>

<p>It is an interesting historical fact that the first
vessel of war ever built in Russia was launched at
Nijni by a company of merchants from Holstein,
who obtained permission in the seventeenth century
to open a trade with Persia and India by way of the
Caspian sea. The vessel was called the Friedrich.
The travels of Olearius were in connection with this
undertaking, of which there is a great history, to be
recounted on some other occasion.</p>

<p>The town has many fine modern buildings. In
the ordinary way, the best view to be had of it and
the surrounding country is from the “Otkos” or
terrace built by order of the Emperor Nicholas.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It
is said to be one of the best views in Europe. As
far as the eye can reach extends the vast alluvial
plain, rich with culture, and occasionally dotted with
forests; whilst the Volga, flowing down from Tver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
looks like a broad blue ribbon stretched over the
country from one extremity of the horizon to the
other. Much of the plain below is inundated in
spring by the overflowing of the river, leaving a
fertile deposit which considerably enhances the value
of the land. The stationary population of the town
does not exceed 30,000 or 40,000, but during the
fair the inhabitants swell up to considerably over
200,000; and this quite irrespective of prodigious
numbers of casual visitors. The ancient Kremlin,
with its low arched gates, whitewashed towers, and
crenellated walls, is one of the sights of the place.
The thick green foliage of the gardens and the gay
residences of the inhabitants all blend into a very
picturesque whole.</p>

<p><i>Site of the Fair.</i>—We must next take a glance at
the site of the fair, which is outside the town, and
can hardly be seen from the gates. Turn then
from the Volga, or Asiatic direction, and there,
across the Oka (here about a quarter of a mile
broad), is a low, almost inundated flat, of triangular
shape, between the two rivers. This was regarded
as the most convenient site. Great difficulties were
presented by the swampy nature of the soil. Deep
sewers vaulted over were constructed through the
morass; these being connected by canals with the
rivers. The buildings for the bazaars were raised
on piles, and the whole boggy surface of the plain
was covered to the depth of some feet with gravel
and clean sand. Through this the ordinary surface
water and the inundated flow percolates, and leaves
clean passages or roads. In the midst of the plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
is the great bazaar—an immense rectangular market-place—divided
by lanes or passages, intersecting at
right angles into sixty-four square groups of warehouses,
or blocks of stone-built buildings, two
storeys high, with projecting verandahs, so as to
shelter goods and passengers from the sun or rain;
containing, besides some public offices in the centre,
2,522 large stores for merchandise, to each of which
is a small chamber for the merchant.</p>

<p>The connecting streets are some thirty or forty
yards wide; and the centre avenue is yet much
wider, and planted with trees. These streets much
resemble those of Cairo, Smyrna, and other oriental
towns. In the centre of that block of permanent
buildings is located the official residence of the
governor during the fair, as also all the business offices
for the administration. It was in this official residence
that the Duke of Edinburgh stayed during his visit
to the fair a few years since. It is equivalent to the
royal pavilion of some of the early English fairs.
The principal avenues of the fair are connected with
some ten miles of wharves or river frontage; and
during the fair bridges are erected so as to give
easy access from the town to the fair. The cost of
preparing the site and the principal buildings was
forty millions of roubles—£1,670,000 sterling. The
fair, however, has long outgrown the original
limits, and miles of temporary structures spring into
existence for the occasion. It extends over some
seven or eight square miles!</p>

<p><i>Unloading.</i>—As the period of the fair approaches,
the ordinary desolation of the location passes rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
away. The rivers, busy indeed at all times when
navigation is possible, now become almost blocked
by traffic. A perfect forest of masts is visible. All
distinct trace of the ordinary bridge of boats seems
lost. The 400 or 500 steamers, built mainly in
England and Belgium, which in the ordinary way
are trading on the 1,600 miles from this to the
Caspian sea, all seem concentrated here. They dart
about like straws on these mighty rivers. But more
striking-looking are the quaint mediæval-looking
barges, coming as they do from the most distant
parts of the empire, piloted through canals and
rivers in order to find their appointed place here.
These are all being rapidly discharged of their cargoes
by an army of ragged Tartar labourers. Here
will be found merchandise from every quarter of the
globe; merchandise which has in some cases been
several years on its way hither; merchandise which
comes from localities so remote as not to be brought
into voluntary association with this fair. Centuries
ago, we are told by the historian of Genoa, the
Genoese merchants built larger ships than were required
for their regular trading operations, ships
calculated to withstand the terrors of the Bay of
Biscay, and the storms of the German Ocean, in
order to make voyages to the Hanseatic towns, to
Wisburg and Gotland, as also to the coast of Russia
in order to participate in this great fair (Bent’s
“Genoa,” 1881, p. 107).</p>

<p><i>The Fair.</i>—And now we arrive at the fair itself.
Round the public offices in the centre are ranged
the European wares, the French millinery, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
English broadcloth. Next follow the Armenians, a
numerous and distinguished class in every commercial
assemblage throughout the East. Near these
the Bokharians usually range themselves, and they
are easily distinguishable from other Asiatics by their
squat corpulent figures and dark complexions.
Nearly a whole side of the bazaar is occupied by the
Chinese market, in which the shops are all laid out
in Chinese fashion. Tea is the chief article of the
Chinese trade; and on this portion of the fair I shall
speak later. Beyond the stone buildings of the
bazaar commence the rows of wooden booths in
which the motley Siberian and Tartar tribes establish
themselves with their furs and peltry; the
most remarkable to a European eye, though not the
least common of their wares, being the dark mouse-coloured
hide of the wild horse, with black mane
and streak along the back, much prized by the
Bashkirs and other tribes for its warmth as well as
beauty.</p>

<p>The wine trade has never constituted a great
feature of the fair, although wine skins from the
Caucasus may be seen; and many of the brands of
southern Russia may be found on application.</p>

<p>Most of the streets of the fair have elegant light
arcades on each side, supported in front by cast-iron
columns, where purchasers can walk about, well
sheltered in all kinds of weather. The stalls are
generally very handsome, and in some instances extend
from street to street, so as to leave two fronts.
They present nothing of the confusion of an ordinary
fair; the goods of every kind are as neatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
ranged as in the shops of a city. To facilitate
business there is a separate quarter set apart for each
different and important class of goods. One
quarter contains groceries, of which the value sold
is very great. In another, dried fish and caviar are
exposed in most fragrant variety, of which great
quantities are sold, amounting to about £60,000 in
value. I may here remark that the annual value
of the sturgeon alone taken in the Volga is estimated
at two and half millions of roubles; and above
30,000 barrels of caviar have been dispatched from
Astrakhan in a single year. A third quarter contains
leather articles of every kind, which may be
bought exceedingly cheap; boots and shoes are disposed
of in very large quantities. Morocco leather
is also sold wholesale to a very large amount. A
great deal of it comes from Astrakhan, where, as in
other parts of European Russia, goats are kept for
the use of their hides to make this leather, more
than for their milk or flesh. The pleasant soap of
Kasan is sold in large quantities. One is glad to
find that it is in such demand.</p>

<p>The iron and iron-ware stored in the mile of
shops where nothing but this metal is sold, has been
brought at immense expense from Siberia; yet much
of it in its original crude state probably came from
Tula, not a great distance from where it is now, in
its highly finished form, exposed for sale. Weapons
and glittering arms of all kinds occupy conspicuous
places in the hardware stores. There is, as a set-off,
a very considerable supply of holy images and
priestly vestments!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>The cloth range is large and well stocked. One
quarter contains ready-made clothes of all descriptions.
The cloaks alike for men and women are
made from stuffs with most singular patterns. Some
of the figured works from Asia are really beautiful.
The value of the woollen goods (Russian and
foreign) sold annually is seldom less than three millions
of roubles—£375,000. The quarter for fancy
articles—gloves, handkerchiefs, ribbons, &amp;c.,—is
always crowded with purchasers, attracted by the
graces of the fair occupants from Rue St. Honoré.
The division for cotton goods is fully stocked. The
mills of England are largely drawn upon for these;
but they are not in the hands of Englishmen at this
fair. The value of cotton goods sold here averages
about twenty-two million roubles—£2,750,000! A
grand display is made by the silks and shawls, chiefly
of oriental manufacture, and hence in very brilliant
colours. The manufactured silks disposed of here
yearly are estimated at ten and half millions of
roubles, or £1,312,000; while of raw silk there is sold
over 300,000 lbs. The furniture shops constitute a
great feature of the fair; and one can but be surprised
to see costly carved tables, chairs, sofas, and
still more large and valuable mirrors from France
and St. Petersburg. Glass and crystal articles, mainly
from Bohemia, constitute a very attractive display,
while the jewellery alike of Europe and of Asia is
always a source of considerable attraction, and the
means of creating a large expenditure of cash. The
precious stones from Bokhara and other parts of
Central Asia are placed in the most tempting prominence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
and profusion. But beware of talismans and
turquoises that appear to be cheap; they will probably
be found equally cheap and much more satisfactory
nearer home. The malachite and lapis-lazuli
ornaments and other stones from Siberia are sometimes
good investments; but some expert knowledge
is required. Curious belts of silver may be
purchased, but not without long bargaining. The
hall-mark is represented by the number 84. There
is a stall for the sale of ornaments in gold and silver,
set with Siberian and Persian stones. Beware! But
it is impossible to recount in any detail all that may
be purchased or seen.</p>

<p><i>The Tea Quarter.</i>—One of the most singular
sights of the fair is the tea quarter, which occupies
the greater portion of an immense division standing
by itself, and distinguishable by its Chinese architecture.
The Chinese superintend this business themselves,
or rather formerly did so. Along the wharves
enormous pyramids of chests of tea are heaped
upon the ground, covered only with matting made
from the inner bark of the birch tree. These
chests of tea, called “tsibiki,” are so packed as to
be impervious to rain or damp. Outside the ordinary
wooden chest is a covering of wickerwork of
cane or bamboo, round which, at Kiakhta, raw bull-hides
are tightly stretched, with the hair inwards.
These chests arrive at Nijni from China, having
been received in barter, at Kiakhta or Maimatchin,
on the Chinese border of Russia. The Russians,
who are great tea drinkers, are accustomed to the
higher qualities of tea grown in North China; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
these are now quite as easily obtained from Canton
as from <i>Kiakhta</i> (which see), and it is said (contrary
to former belief) that the sea carriage has no deteriorating
effect whatever. Here may be seen some
kinds of tea which scarcely ever enter into the
English trade, viz. yellow and brick, the former of
a delicious fragrance and very pale, but injurious to
the nerves if taken very frequently; it is handed
round after dinner, in lieu of coffee, in Russia.
The brick tea is consumed by the Kalmucks and
Kirghizes of the Steppe. The best yellow tea sells
for about 35<i>s.</i> per pound. The tea trade of the
fair has shown a tendency to decrease.</p>

<p><i>Outskirts of the Fair.</i>—To the casual visitor the
outskirts of the fair are almost more interesting than
its centre, for observation and study. The constant
succession of carts in long strings; the crowds of
labourers; the knots of earnest-looking traders with
long beards; the itinerant vendors of liquid refreshments
and white rabbit-skins; the greasy
slovenly monk collecting kopecks of those who fear
to withhold their charity lest their transactions be
influenced by the Evil One; the frequent beggars,
pleading for the most part that they have been
burned out, and showing the most dreadful-looking
sores as evidence of their veracity; all these go to
make up the great assemblage, the unique <i>tout ensemble</i>
of the great fair of Nijni-Novgorod as it has
been, and is to-day. How long will it remain?</p>

<p><i>Administration of Fair.</i>—The administration of
the fair is carried on under the supervision of the
Governor of the Province; the arrangement of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
commercial matters and adjustment of difficulties
being entrusted to a committee of gentlemen called
the “Fair Committee,” chosen from among the
assembled merchants. This committee consists of a
president, three aldermen, and three committee-men,
besides the manager of the fair-office and the
mayor of the town of Nijni. The management of
all Government property is in the hands of this
committee. The letting of shops and store-houses
and the erection of bridges and all temporary works
comes also within their province. The conditions
on which the shops and stores built by Government
are let to merchants and dealers are exceedingly
liberal, and this rent is the sole profit made by Government
on the transactions of the fair. No imposts
of any kind are levied in the shape of licences
or duties. Shops are let to the first applicant, the
sole reservation being that the occupier of the
previous year has a prior claim. In order to promote
competition, each row of buildings is devoted
to a certain kind of merchandise, thus obliging the
merchants to endeavour to undersell one another.
To prevent monopolies or over-speculation, no merchant
is allowed to hire more than three consecutive
shops, nor is he allowed to occupy more than one
shop unless they adjoin each other. The number
of shops let in 1874 was 6,086, and their total rent
amounted to something over £28,000.</p>

<p>The fair lasts six weeks—the really busy period
being from the 18th to 27th August, when the
height is reached. Some fifteen days beyond are
allowed for the settlement of accounts. The usance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
of the fair is twelve months credit, <i>i.e.</i> from one
great fair to the following; but sometimes, in dull
times, and under special circumstances, as much as
two years credit is given. This was particularly
the case in 1849.</p>

<p><i>Trade of the Fair.</i>—The annual trade of the fair
has been the subject of various conjectures; but I
believe the Government of the Province has caused
careful estimates to be made from time to time. In
1697 the trade of the fair was estimated at £12,000
per annum—evidently far too low. In 1790 it
was stated to be £4,500,000!</p>

<p>The following are the details of the principal
branches of the fair in 1849, which were understood
to be less than the transactions of the preceding year:
money being scarce, and there was a stagnation in
the grain trade. The total estimate of the Russian
produce offered for sale was £7,916,016, of which
there were sold raw produce £1,917,940; provisions
£858,684; home manufactures £3,981,716—total
£6,758,340, leaving £1,157,675 unsold. The value
of the foreign goods and produce was estimated at
£2,430,191; of these Asiatic articles sold to the
extent of £1,329,131; European raw materials
£493,955, and manufactured goods £204,888—leaving
£402,217 unsold. So that the total merchandise
at the fair was estimated at the value of
10½ millions sterling, of which about nine millions
were sold.</p>

<p>In Murray’s “Handbook of Russia,” written by
Mr. Michell, the then well-known British Consul,
and published in 1868, it is stated that the aggregate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
sale and purchases at the fair represented about sixteen
millions sterling; which dealings were conducted
by from 150,000 to 200,000 traders from
the various countries of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Mr. Doria, secretary of the British Embassy at
St. Petersburg, reported that the trade of the fair had
increased from about six millions sterling in 1847 to
over £20,000,000 in 1874 (165 millions of roubles),
when upwards of 6,000 shops were let. The iron
sold in various forms amounted to 5,557,800 pouds
of 36 lbs.—the value being £2,193,812. Tea of
the value of about £1,200,000 was sold.</p>

<p>At the fair of 1879 the iron trade figured largely,
and the following facts were obtained regarding the
supplies. The Russian ironmasters sent 15,130,498
pouds (1 poud = 36 lbs.) of wrought iron, steel,
and metal work, of the value of 7,528,350 roubles.
A considerable amount was also imported into the
iron ports of the Volga, viz. at Laïchev, 1,337,541
pouds; Kasan, 16,474; Simbirsk, 22,066; Saratov,
92,361; Rostov, on the Don, 67,762. Cast iron
was not in great force, there being only 530,488
pouds, of the value of 412,475 roubles. One of the
largest contributions was sent from the works of
Count Strogonof, being 6,725,588 pouds.</p>

<p><i>Revenue of the Fair.</i>—The fair constitutes a source
of State revenue. When in 1751 the fair first became
the property of the State, its tolls or revenues
were farmed at about £150 per annum. In the
reign of the Emperor Paul (end of last century)
the farmer of the tolls engaged to build a new
bazaar, and to pay £4,500 a year into the exchequer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
In 1824 a new governor’s house, bazaar,
and shops were erected, already described, and an
annual sum of £8,000, part of the rental of these,
was appropriated to pay the cost of these buildings.
The rental, as we have seen, is now approximating
to £30,000.</p>

<p>A “charity dormitory” was fitted up by Count
Ignatieff, with accommodation for some 250 houseless
vagrants; but if all of this class who are present
were to apply for admission, probably accommodation
for 20,000 would be needed!</p>

<p>The mode of estimating the number of persons
attending the fair is peculiarly ingenious. The
bakers are required to make daily returns of the
quantity of bread they sell, and in this manner an
approximation is arrived at. Of those present at
the fair, only about one in a hundred are female.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that there is an excellent
restaurant under the governor’s house in the fair.
Some of the refreshment booths in the fair present
a remarkable sight, and, we may fairly add, smell!
The “Armenian kitchen” is one of the sights.
Excellent horse-flesh may be had at the Tartar
restaurants!</p>

<p>The passport system has been abolished as to
persons attending the fair, the governor finding it
impossible to examine, or indeed even to open the
40,000 documents per day that were formerly sent
in. Besides, identification is out of the question;
and the pick-pocket fraternity use to purchase, or
more appropriately steal, the authorization they required
under the old system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p><i>Sanitary Arrangements.</i>—The sanitary arrangements
of the fair constitute by no means an unimportant
feature. To a sometimes tropical heat
there is the usual accompaniment of clouds of
finely pulverised dust. The Easterns assembled
are not proverbial for habits of personal cleanliness.
There is indeed an aroma unmistakable. The
sewers are flushed several times a day by means of
water drawn from Lake Mestcherski, giving a fall
of six yards into the river Oka. Round the central
bazaar is a small canal, provided in case of outbreak
of fire, and found valuable on many occasions.
Smoking is prohibited within the limits of the fair
under a fine of twenty-five roubles. The fair is
guarded by a special service of Cossacks and police.</p>

<p>Amongst the amusements are a theatre with a
very good ballet, for which latter Russia is famous.</p>

<p>There is a belief that the glory of the fair is departing.
Wallace, in his “Russia,” 1877 (ii. 196-7),
says:—“I went to the great fair—and was disappointed.
All the descriptions of it which I have
read are much too highly coloured. ‘The motley
crowds of Orientals, representing every country
in the East,’ is not visible to the naked eye of a
prosaic observer. A few Georgians, Persians, and
Bokhariots may be seen sitting at their booths or
strolling about; but they are neither very picturesque
nor very interesting in any way. There is a
‘Chinese Row’ where tea is sold, and where the
roofs of the booths show traces of the influence of
pagoda architecture; but I find there no children
of the Celestial Empire. As to the various kinds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
of merchandise, they may all be seen to much better
advantage in the shops and bazaars of Moscow.
Altogether, I should advise the traveller not to go
very far out of his way to visit this great annual
gathering, which is commonly spoken of by Russians—especially
by those of them who have never seen
it—as if it were one of the seven wonders of the
world.” This is in conformity with the general
depreciatory style of the entire work.</p>

<p>I ought not to omit mention of a little privately-printed
book, “The Great Fair of Nijni Novogorod,
and How we got there.” By William
Forsyth, Q.C. (1865.) He too was disappointed
with the fair.</p>

<p><i>Two smaller Fairs.</i>—Beyond the great fair which
I have now described as fully as space would permit,
there are two other fairs at Nijni, which, however,
are little visited by foreigners. The one held in
January on the ice, at the mouth of the Oka, is
devoted to the selling of wooden wares, such as
boxes and toys. Great numbers of people come to
this fair from the neighbouring villages. In January,
1864, the ice on which the booths and inns were
constructed gave way, and a considerable number
of men, women, children, and horses miserably
perished by drowning. Since then this winter fair
can hardly be said to have revived.</p>

<p>The other fair held on 6th July (N. S.) is for the
sale of horses.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Irbit, in the government of Perm, in
Asiatic Russia.—The town is small,
with a population of little more than
1,000. It is enclosed with palisades,
and contains two churches and a market-place surrounded
with shops. Here in past times a noted
fair was held annually, attended by Russian merchants
on their way to Kiakhta. In more recent
times it has been superseded by the fairs of
Yekaterinburg and Nijni.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kiakhta</span> (sometimes designated Maimatchin,
the depot for commerce).—This town is situated
in Asiatic Russia, in the government of Irkutsk, on
the Chinese frontier. The fair appears to have
been established by treaty between China and
Russia towards the latter part of the sixteenth
century. The mode of business is after the fashion
of those early barter marts, which fairs originally
were. The reason for this state of things here is
that the Russians are prohibited from exporting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
their coin, and there is no rate of exchange or other
facilities for bills of exchange between the two
countries. The Russian commodities are transported
by land from St. Petersburg and Moscow to
Tobolsk. From thence the merchants and merchandise
may embark upon the Irtish down to its
junction with the Oby; they can then work up the
last-named river as far as Narym, where they enter
the Ket, which they ascend to Makoffskoi-Osteog.
At that place the merchandise is conveyed about
ninety versts on land to the Yenisie. It is then
necessary to ascend that river, the Tunguska, and
Angara to Irkutsk, cross the Baikal Lake, and go up
the river Selenga almost to Kiakhta. On account
of the labour of working up so many rapid rivers,
and of the incessant transhipments—which can
hardly be accomplished in one summer—many
prefer to go overland altogether. They make as
a general rendezvous the town of Irbit, where a
considerable fair was formerly held. From thence
the progress is in sledges during the winter to
Kiakhta, which is usually reached in February—the
season in which the chief commerce is carried
on with the Chinese. The Russian merchants purchase
on their way all the furs they can find in the
small towns, where they are brought from the adjacent
countries. When they return in the spring
with the Chinese goods, chiefly tea, occupying great
bulk, the water route is preferred. Formerly the
woollen cloths of Prussia were conveyed to this
fair in large quantities—to the value of some
£1,500,000—by the Russian merchants. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
manufactories of Poland and Russia now furnish
the cloth taken to China.</p>

<p>The mode of procedure in the dealings is this:
The Chinese merchant comes and examines the
goods he requires in the warehouse of the Russian
trader. When the price is settled, the goods are
sealed in the presence of the Chinese. Both parties
then repair to the Mai-ma-tshin, where the Russian
chooses his commodities, and leaves behind him a
person of confidence, who remains in the warehouse
until the Russian goods are delivered. About
8,000,000 lbs. of tea, of which two-thirds are of
superior quality, were formerly taken into Russia as
the proceeds of this barter. There is a small duty
levied on the produce of each country. The trade
has fallen off since sea-borne tea became prevalent.
Much of this now goes to Odessa through the Suez
Canal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yekaterinburg</span> (or Ekaterinburg or Jekaterinburg),
in the government of Perm in Asiatic Russia,
forming the capital of the mining districts of the
Ural. It is a modern place, and a considerable fair
has sprung up, superseding that formerly held at
Irbit.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> We shall find that at a later period the sale of slaves was

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The protection from “evil tolls” was also a matter of
great consequence. It was to be regarded as a security from
paying so large a custom or imposition upon any goods that
the fair profit is lost therein, and the trade thereby prevented.
The original term expressive of this is <i>Mala Tolneta</i>, the word
toll or tolt being derived from the Saxon <i>Tholl</i>, Low Latin <i>Tolnetum</i>, or <i>Theolonium</i>,
which signifies a payment in markets, towns, and fairs,
for goods and cattle bought and sold. It also stands for any
manner of custom, subsidy, imposition, or sum of money taken
of the buyer for the importing or exporting of any wares; and
it may be assumed that the words in <i>Magna Charta</i> were used
in their evident sense. The compound word <i>Mala-tolneta</i>,
which appears in the original text, signifies bad or evil tolls,
or unjust exactions. In the later statutes it is rendered into
French by the ancient term <i>Maletout</i> (<i>Vide</i> R. Thomson’s
“Notes on the Great Charters,” 1829).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> In illustration of the early custom of holding foreigners
living or trading in England responsible for the offences and
crimes of other foreigners, the following instance may be given.
In 1301 a person belonging to the house of the Spini, of
Florence, was killed in a squabble with some other people
belonging to the same house in England, and the guilty person
having absconded, the officers of justice seized the bodies and
goods of other persons belonging to the company, and also
(luckily for the merchants), a sum of money collected by them
in Ireland for the <i>Pope</i>, and some merchandise purchased on
his account. He (the Pope) immediately sent a Bull to England
requiring the liberation of the people and property arrested
(“Fœdera,” v. ii., p. 891).</p>

<p class="center">Reproduced in Facsimile,—With an Historical and Bibliographical
Introduction by <span class="smcap">John Ashton</span>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Ballade of the Scottysshe Kynge</span> is the earliest known printed
English ballad; it was discovered under curious and interesting circumstances,
which are narrated in detail in the Introduction, and is here
very carefully facsimiled. A limited number of copies were issued in a
tasteful form for those collectors of ballads and connoisseurs of early printing
who desire to possess the work in the nearest shape to its original form.
It is accompanied by an Historical and Bibliographical Introduction,
giving an account of the various printed forms of the incidents it records,
with Illustrative Quotations from the more important of them; also
Notes from Contemporary History, elucidating the events of the Ballad,
and other information interesting to the Antiquary and the Bibliographer.</p>

Introduction by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Napier</span>. This very curious and interesting work
is a reproduction of a fourteenth century cookery book, containing
numerous recipes for dishes which were in common use at that period,
many of which are now obsolete; others are evidently the early counterparts
of made dishes of the present day. The work also furnishes a
number of <i>menus</i> of great contemporary feasts, which throw much fresh
light on the domestic habits of our ancestors.</p>
